The victim did so and worked daily, getting rewards for completing each task. However, the platform kept asking the victim to deposit increasing amounts of their own money to continue working. Further, the platform wouldn’t allow withdrawals unless the victim increased their “credibility rating” by depositing more funds. Eventually, the victim had to borrow money to continue to be able to work on the RIOT mining platform. Despite depositing nearly $81,000, the platform never allowed the victim to withdraw their funds. \n\nThis is not to be confused with the investment company, Riot Platforms at https://www.riotplatforms.com/",

The online acquaintance persuaded the victim to deposit $45,000 into a trading account on MIC Markets.  Over time, the victim believed they had doubled their money trading crypto assets.  At first, the victim was able to withdraw small amounts of money from their trading account.  But, when the victim tried to withdraw their total balance, their withdrawal was blocked.  The site demanded that the victim pay ”taxes” before they could withdraw.  They have since been unable to withdraw anything.\n\nThe second victim was introduced to MIC Markets by someone they met on a popular dating app.  After moving the conversation to WhatsApp, the romantic interest asked the victim to join him in investing money to create a strong financial future together.  The romantic interest asked the victim to download a Bitcoin wallet app and the MIC Markets trading app.  The imposter then appeared to add $1,000 to the victim’s account and executed a few trades, quickly making a 25% profit.  Based on this demonstration, the victim transferred \nthousands of dollars to their MIC Markets account, believing they would be able to turn a similar profit.  But then the romantic interest bullied the victim into funding their account with even more money, either from their 401(k) or from personal loans.  The victim subsequently took out a $20,000 loan and transferred it to their MIC Markets account.  \n\nOnce the victim’s profit reached $50,000, they tried to withdraw it.  But MIC Markets refused to process the withdrawal and demanded a 20% fee.  The romantic interest promised to pay part of the fee if the victim paid the rest using money from their 401(k).  At some point, the victim discovered that the romantic interest had used someone else’s photos and information to create a fake dating profile.  Soon after, MIC Markets blocked the victim from accessing their account at all.  The site is no longer operational.  In total, the victim lost about $20,000 to MIC Markets.",

The friend instructed the victim how to download the application called SAXO Group and open an account there, and then how to transfer crypto assets into the account. The victim followed the instructions and believed they were making money, but when they tried to withdraw their funds, the site demanded they pay more than $65,000 for “personal” taxes. The victim was unable to recover their money.   All told, they lost $49,000 to the site.\n\nThe second victim received a call from “Lee”, who introduced them to a gold investment opportunity through Saxo Group. Lee provided instructions on how to download the Saxo app and create an account. Over time, Lee encouraged the victim to transfer more and more money into the account. The victim believed they were earning profits from their trading. But when they tried to withdraw funds, the site demanded they pay more than $500,000 for “advance” taxes to the Dutch government. The victim paid the tax, and soon after Lee stopped talking to the victim.

    "complaint_narrative": "Several Californians report a WhatsApp investment group called DAF Finance Institute.  The group claimed to offer a new crypto trading product they had developed called “AI Profit Algorithms 4.0”, available through a crypto asset trading platform referred to as OPACOIN, OPNCOIN, or OPN-GO.  The group claimed they had received funding for the product from legitimate sources such as FINRA, and that the product was in the final stages of testing.  DAF Finance Institute promised members that the product would allow them to trade cryptocurrencies before the initial coin offering (ICO’s) and would help them make large profits after the ICO occurred.  DAF said that the volatility of the crypto market brought potential for immense profit.\n\nAt first, the group gave members a $500 trial investment to use on the OPACOIN platform.  Several Californians report watching their trial investments grow, and that they were even able to successfully withdraw the initial $500.  After the trial investment period, DAF group members were encouraged to invest $5,000 on the site.  One victim tried to withdraw their funds after trading with the $5,000 investment but was denied.  Another victim invested $22,000 at this stage based on the promise that they would be fully reimbursed if their investment failed.  However, when they tried to withdraw, they were told they could not because one of their trades was “executed late”.  \n\nAfter a few months of trading on OPACOIN, DAF members were encouraged to invest an additional $50,000.  One victim signed a $50,000 investment contract with DAF Finance Institute, where DAF guaranteed a 300% return on the victim’s investment over just a three-month trading period.  Another victim invested $50,000 into their account, but was told that their investment had completely failed, resulting in a total loss.  This victim was encouraged to keep silent about their losses, and they lost access to the WhatsApp group shortly after.",

    "complaint_narrative": "Another victim told the group that they wanted to invest, but did not have $50,000.  This victim was told the group could lend them the money, and that the loan could be repaid with trading profits.  But when the victim later tried to withdraw some of their profits from this $50,000 “loan”, the platform threatened that they needed to repay the loan with outside funds or be sued.  That victim then withdrew enough money from their 401(k) retirement account to cover the “loan”, but suffered heavy withdrawal penalties in the process.  The victim was promised that their trading gains would be sufficient to cover those penalties.  However, when the victim tried to withdraw their profits a second time, they were told they first had to pay a 10% fee to cover taxes, and that this fee must also be paid using outside funds.  At that point, the victim’s contacts in the group stopped communicating with them, and they have since been unable to withdraw their funds.\n\nMeanwhile, after the $50,000 round, other members were pressured to invest $150,000 more toward ICO subscriptions on OPACOIN.  One member did invest the additional $150,000, but when they tried to withdraw funds, they were told they had to first pay a $20,000 fee.  That victim has also been unable to recover their funds.

Encouraged by the initial success and seamless withdrawals to their Coinbase account, the victim decided to invest larger amounts. Eventually, they deposited $32,000, aiming to reach the $50,000 threshold required to fully join the group.   But in just 20 minutes, the victim reported that they lost the entire amount deposited into bdswissasias.com, apparently due to an open trading position going south.\n\nThe victim solicited help from the group to recover the lost funds. Over the next week, the victim rebuilt their balance to $40,000 after depositing an additional $20,000, followed by another $15,000. Following David's trading signals, the balance eventually reached $207,000. \n\nBut when the victim tried to withdraw funds, they were told their \"credit score\" had dropped by one point and they needed to pay a $10,000 \"recharge\" fee to restore it to 100 points. After complying, they were informed that the delay had caused their score to drop further, and now an additional $50,000 was required to bring the score back to 100.\n\nThe victim has not recovered any of the $100,000 they deposited on the platform.  The website is no longer operational.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the forex & cfd trading company BDSWiss at https://global.bdswiss.com/.",

All told, they transferred $650,000 to the platform and has not been able to recover any of that.\n\nThe second victim met “Leena” via text message. Leena claimed to be a Hong Kong native that moved to Boston to work for a prominent consulting firm. After a few conversations, Leena invited the victim to join an investing group on Telegram and open a trading account at h5.coinmatevip.com. The victim then transferred crypto assets to the platform. Over the course of three months, the victim participated with members of the group chat in various option trades on the platform.

All told, the victim transferred $330,00 to the platform and has not been able to recover any of it.\n\nThe third victim also reported being invited to join an “investment consortium” on Telegram. At the direction of the group chat, they opened an account and transferred funds to a UK-based trading platform called coinmatevp.com. After a few months, the investment group on Telegram disbanded, but the victim was still able to trade and their account experienced significant growth on the platform. But when the victim tried to withdraw funds, the platform demanded they pay “tax and consortium fee payments”. The victim paid, but coinmatevp.com informed them that their funds were frozen by the “World Anti-Money Laundering Task Force (FATF)” due to unusual trading activities and they would need to pay an additional $50,000  to confirm they were not involved in money laundering activities. At this point the victim realized that the platform is a scam and reported the incident.

However, when the victim tried to withdraw their funds, they were told that the site was undergoing “ERC 20 network maintenance” and to wait 24 hours. The next day, the victim day saw that their account had been disabled.  The victim contacted the website’s customer support, but were told that all their crypto assets had been transferred to another exchange. The website provided no details about this transfer, and no longer appears operational. \n\nThe second victim reports being contacted by a woman about a crypto asset investment opportunity in YoBitPro. The victim said they were not interested, but the woman continued to show pictures of luxury cars and apartments that she purportedly owned as a result of crypto asset trading. The women convinced the victim that she would help them invest and finally the victim invested $1,000. The women showed the victim that the investment had doubled on the trading platform. The victim then invested $160,000 and watched their investment grow to $620,000 within 2 months. The victim reported sending funds to wallet addresses 0xd33F76dA78669B41ABcb98234Abb887bFe2D4F0a and 0x074580e8Ad363e06A904602Fac3b28beC21B2303. However, when the victim tried to withdraw their funds, the website indicated that they needed to pay taxes on the money earned to the platform in order to receive their funds. When the victim questioned why they would need to pay taxes to the platform and not the IRS, the company provided a vague answer about being an offshore company and needing to pay off the taxes in order to return the funds back to the victim.  Furthermore, the company attempted to steal additional funds from the victim through follow up emails that instructed the victim to send payments to wallet addresses 0x074580e8Ad363e06A904602Fac3b28beC21B2303 and 0x232bf7c4096b3639eb9AFfB5902d9bE72138bC6B. At this point, the victim realized this was a scam and reported the incident.",

The victim was asked to provide identification and a screenshot of their last withdrawal transaction details in order to verify their account. After providing the requested information, the platform’s customer support sent another message saying the victim’s funds would be frozen until they paid a 20% of the account balance as a “risk deposit” for “safe capital verification”. Since then, the victim has not been able to recover any of their funds from the platform.\n\nThe second victim reports receiving a text message from a stranger “Anita,” and the two kept in touch. At some point, Anita convinced the victim to invest in crypto assets, and directed them to install a mobile app called Mercatox Exchange from the iPhone App Store. The victim made an initial investment of $50,000. After more investments, the victim was led to believe that their account balance on the app had  grown to around $1.5 million. At some point, the victim was told to transfer their account balance from Mercatox to Whitemaxus.com which they did, and continued to invest more money.. However, when the victim tried to withdraw $300,000 from the app, they were told that the ERC-20 network was very slow and that their withdrawal would take a long time. The victim tried to contact the platform’s customer support via online chats and emails but has not received any response from the platform nor have they been able to recover any of their funds. They invested close to $500,000 on these platforms.",

Under Carl's guidance, the victim created a Trust Wallet account and connect it to http://cyruptagdfx.top, which Carl claimed was a “decentralized app,” (or “DApp\"). \n\nFollowing Carl's instructions, the victim made several fund transfers and conducted trades on the platform based on Carl's signals,  believing they were making good profits. The victim wanted to stop trading, but Carl pressured the victim to keep investing, claiming he would make a large deposit of $143,000 into the victim's wallet.\n\nHowever, this triggered a demand from the DApp “customer support” to provide a “verification deposit” of $103,000 or the funds would be frozen. The victim cashed out their 401k and borrowed additional funds to make this deposit. After that, the victim attempted to withdraw some funds, but the DApp customer support accused her of providing a false bank account and demanded an additional fee of $95,000 and threatened to report the victim to the CFTC and FBI. The victim took out bank loans totaling over $135,600 to pay this second deposit, and Carl then suggested that the victim give him some of the money to trade on their behalf so they could make back that money. But Carl soon reported he had lost all the money in a bad trade. He also claimed he had sold his kidney to help pay for the second deposit and demanded money from the victim to pay for medical treatment. \n\nMeanwhile, customer support at the DApp cyruptagdfx.top continued to harangue the victim, demanding they pay $50,000 to open a “fast withdrawal channel” and threatening to add late fees for every day the victim did not pay. At one point the victim visited the DApp’s webpage and was redirected to another website, where a customer service agent there demanded the victim pay another $50,000 to release her finds.

There, Mary persuaded the victim to invest with her through Coinegg.  Mary presented Coinegg as a means of earning a stable income through investments.  \n\nAt first, Mary instructed the victim to sell all their stocks and crypto assets to fund the investments with Mary.  The victim watched as Mary appeared to use the funds to earn more and more funds through crypto trades.  After showing the victim these apparent gains, Mary persuaded the victim to invest more and more money with her, and even persuaded the victim to take out new loans to fund the investment.  As Mary explained, the more funds the victim contributes, the more stable income they would earn.  In total, the victim paid over $400,000 to Mary before they realized it was a scam.  The victim was unable to withdraw the funds and is now filing for bankruptcy as a result of the scam. Both websites are no longer operational.",

The victim’s balance was so high that they sent the $23,000 to Kenskr to withdraw funds.  Kenskr then asked the victim to transfer another $10,000 as a deposit that would be returned to them after the tax is paid.  After the victim transferred the additional $10,000, Kenskr asked for even more money, saying it was necessary because of “higher U.S. tax deposit requirements”.

    "complaint_narrative": "Two Californians complained separately about the gold trading platform, Sundell Ltd. (Sundell-fx.com).\n\nThe first victim was contacted on LinkedIn by “Amelia” who expressed interest in the victim’s home country of Korea and struck up a casual conversation about life experiences there versus the U.S. The conversations eventually switched to WhatsApp and they continued to talk about many subjects. The victim even had a video call with Amelia. At some point, Amelia told the victim she wanted to be the victim's mentor for financial investments, introducing them to “gold future trading” which they had never heard of. Amelia showed the victim a demo trading platform at Sunderll-fx, and said they could make a profit. Amelia kept asking the victim to transfer more money so they could make more profits. Eventually, the victims’ account showed a profit of $83,000 dollars.  But when the victim attempted to withdraw some funds from the trading platform, their request was denied and the platform asked them to provide an Identification card and bank account for verification process.  The victim called their bank, who advised against this. The victim’s account was eventually deactivated. The victim did some research and found out Sundell-fx was a scam platform and there were other victims who could not withdraw their money. The victim lost $141,000 to this scam.\n  \nThe second victim provided screen shots and copies of emails from Sundell showing how elaborate the scam was. The website claimed that Sundell Ltd was a UK registered online trading platform providing online trading for cryptocurrency, various foreign currencies, and precious metals (gold, silver, etc.). Sundell Ltd also claimed it was registered as a money services business in the US.\n\nThis victim describes themselves as an overseas option trader and used the Sundell platform for trading gold options. They were able to make a few withdrawals, which made them feel comfortable, though the withdrawals represented less than 10% of their investment.  The victim attempted to make another withdraw, but this time Sundell froze his account and demanded he pay a “UK personal income tax” on the entire amount invested. Not only that, but the platform said he couldn’t use his profits to pay the tax, but had to contribute new money, and further, they had to do this before the deadline of about a week or they would permanently freeze their account and take away their assets. The victim's account balance at the time was more than $16 million, and the tax they demanded was almost $800,000. The victim was unable to pay the money before the deadline, so their account was frozen and showed a zero balance. The victim lost more than $350,000 on the platform plus their expected profits, and the website is no longer operational.\n\nThe Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) issued a Consumer Alert against Sundell-fx, and others, alleging they were part of a cryptocurrency scam ring operating out of Los Angeles and San Francisco. (See the link here: https://dfi.wa.gov/consumer/alerts/alleged-cryptocurrency-scam-ring-operating-out-los-angeles-and-san-francisco).\nThe DFPI cautions about websites that claim to be registered, as this does not necessarily mean they are regulated by a government agency.",

The victim expressed interest in investing in crypto and but told Victoria they didn't know much. Victoria said she got into investing after her aunt, who works on Wall Street, taught her. Victoria  showed screen shots of her trades and profits and told the victim that she could teach her how to trade.

The victim began to trust the process and regularly deposited more funds to their DRW trading account. Victoria continued to coach the victim, instructing them to copy their trades and put in the same amount of money they were trading.

After the victim created a crypto wallet and deposited money in Coinrus.com, the scammer had the victim convert his entire balance and trade only using the USDT stablecoin currency. The scammer manipulated trade results to make it look like the victim was making good profits with each trade. The scammer aggressively pressured the victim to add additional funds, and even agreed to transfer $70,000 USDT to the victim’s account after the victim nearly lost everything in a bad trade. The only condition was that the victim would need to invest an additional $20,000, which he did. When the scammer didn’t show up to a planned in-person meeting, the victim got suspicious and tried to withdraw his money, but his request was delayed by Coinrus.com. Later the victim was told that his account was “at risk” and he needed to pay $70,000 to resolve the issue. He declined to pay, and days later, his account history had been erased from the servers. He lost approximately $70,000.\n\nA third Californian was introduced to Coinrus.com by someone he knew as “Yan Xiaoyu.” She and the victim had been trading in crypto for several months with excellent results. Once “Yan Xiaoyu,” who also uses the handle “@Anna255h” on social media, had gained the victim’s trust, she persuaded him to deposit more than $200K on the platform for their trades. The first few months went well, and the victim’s balance reflected a profit of more than $500K. He had successfully made two withdrawals totaling $30K from his account, but when he tried to make a third withdrawal, the website said he needed to pay $132K in taxes before he could get the money. The victim refused to pay the fees and has since lost all access to his account and he cannot reach customer service for the website. He did receive an email stating that they had taken control of his account and were donating his entire $731K balance to charity. All told, this victim invested and lost more than $200K.\n\nA fourth victim met and befriended “Anna” online. After a couple of weeks, “Anna” introduced the victim to cryptocurrency trading, suggesting it would be an easy way for them to make money for their planned future together. At “Anna’s” urging, the victim transferred his $46,000 life savings to the account she told him to open and invested it. The victim’s account balance appeared to grow to more than $150,000 in less than a month, so he attempted to transfer it back to crypto, taking screenshots of the transaction. When he followed up on the transfer, he was told that he entered the deposit address incorrectly, and the website demanded 20% of the transferring funds as a fee for dealing with his mistake.

She sent him a link to the trading platform “Hong Kong Selead Group Limited” where he registered for a foreign exchange trading account. The victim made multiple wire transfers to the site, sending approximately $2.9 million. With the assistance of “Sally” at Hong Kong Selead Customer Service, he thought he was making profitable trades, and eventually believed his account was worth more that $15 million. At some point, Sally helped him transfer his crypto assets to an entity called “Copper Crypto,” which he believed was a legitimate entity, and he communicated with their Customer Specialist “Nicole” on WhatsApp. But when he tried to withdraw his money, Nicole told him he need to pay 20% in tax on his profit, or more than $1.5 million. Nicole told him that according to the regulations of the “Money Authority” the taxes needed to be paid from an external wallet and could not be deducted from his account. The victim then called the FBI and is working with them. He has not been able to get any of his money back. Both UK and Hong Kong authorities have posted warnings about Hong Kong Selead Group. “Copper Crypto” appears to have impersonated another company, even using their logo.",

    "complaint_narrative": "Two Californians separately complain about the crypto asset exchange, wincoinin.com. The first victim met “Lucy Cheong” via LinkedIn and they began having conversations over the phone. After a while, Lucy suggested that they invest together in crypto assets. Lucy showed the victim how to create an account on “crypto.com” and told them to transfer money from their bank into a “Trust Wallet” and then deposit their crypto assets into an account wincoing.com. Lucy told the victim to wait for her signal on when to trade. Lucy told the victim to enter the amount of crypto assets they wanted to trade on the website, pick a % profit they wanted to make, enter a time of 15- 30 seconds, and then hit the “Buy Long” button. Lucy would then direct the victim to hit the “Confirm Order” button. On the very first trade, the website showed they had made a profit. The victim wanted to stop there, but Lucy insisted they trade again and put in even more money. After the third trade the victim wanted to withdraw, and Lucy showed them how to withdraw through the website and said it would take about 10 minutes. After about 30 minutes of the website showing the withdrawal was “in process”, the victim tried to use the website’s online chat service. After waiting 20 minutes, they got a response saying the funds were in process, but they would need to pay a 12% service fee to access their funds, otherwise the website would freeze the funds and charge a .05% daily late fee. The victim now realizes this is a scam. They lost $290,000 which was their life savings. The second victim provided screenshots from wincoining.com showing he invested $184,000.00 and that he had made $47,000.00 in profits from trading but is unable to withdraw his funds.",

    "complaint_narrative": "A California victim met “Jenny” on the dating app Hinge who introduced him to a crypto mining operation she was participating in. She seemed very knowledgeable in finance and the victim trusted her to help set up an account with a defi protocol on the website: defi.wallet-usdt-eth-erc20.com. He initially put in $1,000.00 to test the system, and since it appeared to be working, he put in an additional $21,000.00. He though he got great results with the website showing mining rewards accruing in his account which were then deposited directly into his wallet on MetaMask. The wallet showed his initial investment funds as always available, and each day he got mining rewards (about 2%) that could be extracted and put into a wallet linked to a so-called “mining pool”. He chatted daily with Jenny about life and crypto. Then the website advertised a reward scheme that offered 12.5 Ethereum coins for every $100,000.00 invested into the platform. Jenny pressured him quite intensely for almost a month to invest so they could get the reward, but he couldn’t come up with the funds. At some point, he liquidated his IRA and put all the rest of his available money into the website account. His total investment at that time was about $37,000.00, and he believed he had earned rewards of $60,000.00. Then he got a message from the website offering a chance to double his rewards in 7 days. He sent the funds to another crypto address outside and was shown that his account had grown to $80,000.00. He wanted to withdraw his funds then, but when he tried, the website demanded he pay taxes of $12,700.00, so he did. Then, he was told he needed to invest an additional 50% of the total asset amount, (another $40,000.00) so that he could take out the $80,000.00 he believed he was in his wallet. He couldn’t pay, so the website agreed to a lower amount, $10,000.00. Immediately after he sent the money, all his money disappeared, and he can no longer communicate with the website. Jenny stopped communicating with him, too. He lost about $58,000.00.",

    "complaint_narrative": "A California victim was introduced by an acquaintance to a Defi Trading platform.  The victim purchased Tether USDT crypto currency from Crypto.com, then connected his offline wallet to the exchange and began trading USDT/Bitcoin futures contracts.  The victim believed he was trading very successfully, so he transferred more money into the platform and believed his acquaintance was also crediting money into his account as well.  The victim made a small withdrawal early in the process to \"test\" the process and his withdrawal went through.  But after more \"successful\" trades, the victim attempted to make a larger withdrawal. At that point, the exchange informed him it did not allow such a large withdrawal, citing “anti-money laundering” protocol established by the “International Banking Regulatory Bureau,” which required him to trade at least 50% of their deposits in their trading account within 24 hours of attempting a withdrawal.   So, the victim deposited more funds into his account, and was told his acquaintance had transferred money into his account as well, so he could withdraw the amount he wanted.  The exchange called this process a “recharge.” Again, the victim believed had made more successful trades and now had enough money to make his planned withdraw as he met the minimum trade threshold.  This time, the exchange denied the withdrawal request, again citing the “International Banking Regulatory Bureau” concern that his account was being used for money laundering, effectively freezing my account to withdrawals. The victim asked how he could prove he was not a money launderer and was told by the exchange he would need to deposit into his wallet the exact amount he had been trying to withdraw, which was $650,000. The victim contacted his trading partner/acquaintance, and she stated her account had also been frozen and that he would need to comply with the exchanges’ instructions. He asked customer service what to do and was told if he transferred the $650,000 and provided a screen shot of the balance, they would release the funds.  The victim took out a loan and deposited about half of the $650,000 in two installments into what he believed was a safe account for such purposes. But as soon as the second deposit went in, without his consent or knowledge the exchange moved the money into his trading account. He protested but was told this was to secure his funds while he finished the verification process. And that the only way to access his money would be to deposit the remaining funds to get to $650,000, although they said they would allow him to trade in the account – just not make withdrawals. His money is now trapped, and he is concerned that there might be problems with the exchange. He is also suspicious about his acquaintance, who told him she followed the exchange’s instructions, borrowed money, and was finally able to withdraw her money and thus encouraged him to borrow more money as well.",

Just when he thought he had finally completed the withdrawal process Manapool told him his account was at risk because it had received an unknown deposit and asked him to pay more than a million dollars to resolve it, or they would freeze or close his account. The victim spent almost all his retirement money trying to get his money out and now believes Manapool is a scam that has to be stopped before it can do harm to more victims.",

Aimee asked to continue the conversation on WhatsApp. Aimee then offered to teach the victim about trading digital assets. The victim purchased cryptocurrency through the Coinbase platform and then transferred money to an App which victim thought was associated with a legitimate company. Victim transferred more than $1 million in 10 different transactions, as directed by Aimee. At some point, Aimee told the victim that the market was unstable, and he should withdraw all the money. But when he tried to withdraw a small amount, the wallet app asked him to confirm his identity and provide identification, which he did, using his US passport as identification. He also provided his bank information for the deposit.\n\nHe then received a text from the wallet app customer service saying he needed to pay taxes of more than $300,000 to the IRS up front. The victim became suspicious and asked if he could just have the taxes deducted from the withdrawal. He was told the app did not have the authority to deduct taxes. The victim then asked to cancel the withdrawal but was told he couldn’t do that either. Instead, the wallet app customer service said he needed to pay the taxes within 7 days and provided an address. The victim reached out to Aimee and asked her about this practice, and she said she has been using this app for many years, and that he should pay his taxes like a good citizen. Aimee also pressured him to obtain loans to pay the taxes. The victim reports he has no luck getting his money back from the wallet app, and that Aimee continues to contact him.

    "complaint_narrative": "The victim got a text message from a stranger calling herself “Arina” a divorced woman from Singapore living in Irvine, California. The initial contact was a “wrong number” but eventually gained the victim’s trust through repeated texts, and at some point asked to move the conversation to the Telegram app. There, the conversation turned to investing and Arina claimed she was making great profits and offered to help the victim trade because they were friends. Arina then directed the victim to a cryptocurrency trading app. At first, the victim invested $500, and after showing that he had made a huge return on investment, Arina told him to make a test withdrawal to make sure that there were no problems, and he was able to withdraw money. Victim did some research on the company, and after seeing his withdrawal go smoothly, he believed it was a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange. After that Arina encouraged the victim to deposit increasing amounts of money, she even told him to take out personal loans in order to achieve greater profits. Then one evening, the victim was randomly looking for more information on the exchange and came across another victim who described the “pig butchering” scam. The victim immediately tried to withdraw all of his funds, but just like the other victim had warned, he got a message from the website’s “customer service team” saying he needed to pay taxes on the money before they would release the funds. The company operated the website at  https://www.decurretbit.com/p/pc. This is not to be confused with the website  www.decurretbit.com.",

Rembrandt sent her a message saying hi and asking to talk about her day. At some point, Rembrandt asked to move the conversation over to WhatsApp, and there, mentioned cryptocurrency trading, telling the victim he could show her how to invest. He directed her to a website, bitstackoption.com. The victim told Rembrandt she didn’t know anything about cryptocurrency, so he directed her to the crypto.com app, and showed her how to open a wallet. He asked how much she had in the bank, which she indicated was not much. He said that was okay, and in fact, he would add $1,000 to whatever she wanted to invest, because that was not much money to him. She invested $2,000 and Rembrandt represented that he added $1,000, and he subsequently told the victim her account was worth more than $14,000. The victim told her mother, who invested $4,000 and was told her balance was more than $28,000. This is not to be confused with the company Bitstack which operates the website at www.bitstrack-app.com.\n\nThe victim subsequently told Rembrandt she and her mother wanted to withdraw their money from their accounts. But they were told by the website they would need to pay fees upfront, and they could not deduct the fees from the withdrawal amount.
