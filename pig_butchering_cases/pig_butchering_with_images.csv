(Entity Impersonating Tesla and Elon Musk)","A California resident reports they viewed a Live Stream on YouTube where “Elon Musk” was offering to give away $100 million in crypto assets. The Livestream provided a QR code that when scanned led to the website webelon.org. Even though the Livestream promised a giveaway, people were required to send crypto assets to the site in order to participate. All told, the victim sent $5,000 to the wallet address bc1qnjy98m5g8d4qctp8s7v5j5jynsqhkdvvwm3840.  The website is no longer operational.

This scam appears to be impersonating Tesla by falsely using Tesla's logo on its promotional materials and platform. This is not to be confused with Tesla at https://www.tesla.com/.
Tesla is not in the business of promoting crypto giveaways.","Fraudulent Trading Platform
