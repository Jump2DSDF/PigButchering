You are a digital forensics expert specializing in cryptocurrency fraud analysis. Your task is to extract structured TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) information from a Pig Butchering scam complaint narrative.

## Task
Analyze the following victim complaint and extract fraud intelligence using a systematic Chain of Thought approach.

## Input
**Case ID:** 16
**Primary Subject:** oslvsap.vip
**Scam Type:** Fraudulent Trading Platform

Pig Butchering Scam
**Website:** https://www.oslvsap.vip
**Complaint Narrative:**
A California resident reports they were approached online by someone who eventually introduced them to the crypto asset trading platform OSL operating at www.oslvsap.vip. The online friend told the victim they could make large profits on the platform. The victim started with a small investment. Over time, the online friend encouraged the victim to deposit more money on the platform, and at one point, believed their account had grown to more than $140,000. But when the victim tried to withdraw funds, the platform demanded they pay a “20% management fee”. After paying the fee, which amounted to $25,000, the platform demanded they pay an additional $21,000 under the guise of some sort of verification fee. The victim has been unable to recover any funds from the platform, which is no longer operational. All told, the victim lost more than $90,000.

## Chain of Thought Analysis

Please follow these steps explicitly and document your reasoning for each:

### Step 1: Initial Contact Analysis (접근 및 유인)
Think through:
- How did the victim first encounter the scammer?
- What platform was used for initial contact?
- Was there a migration to another communication platform?
- What type of lure was used (romance, investment opportunity, etc.)?

### Step 2: Persona & Psychology Analysis (사칭 및 심리)
Think through:
- What identity did the scammer claim?
- What wealth or success indicators were shown?
- What type of relationship was established?
- What psychological manipulation tactics are evident?
- How long was the trust-building phase?

### Step 3: Fraud Mechanism Analysis (사기 수법)
Think through:
- What type of fraudulent platform was used?
- What was the platform name and URL?
- Were fake profits shown to the victim?
- What tactics were used to block withdrawals?

### Step 4: Financial Intelligence Extraction (추적단서)
Think through:
- What cryptocurrencies were involved?
- Are any wallet addresses mentioned?
- Are any transaction hashes mentioned?
- What was the estimated total loss?
- What payment methods were used?

### Step 5: Temporal Analysis (시간적 지표)
Think through:
- How long did the scam last?
- Is the fraudulent platform still operational?

### Step 6: Confidence Assessment
Think through:
- What information was clearly stated vs. inferred?
- What important information is missing?
- Overall confidence in this extraction?

## Output Format

## Important Guidelines
1. Only extract information explicitly stated or strongly implied in the narrative
2. Use "unknown" or null for information not available
3. Be conservative with confidence scores
4. Document all reasoning in the chain_of_thought section
5. For arrays, include all relevant items found
6. Normalize wallet addresses and URLs as found in the text
