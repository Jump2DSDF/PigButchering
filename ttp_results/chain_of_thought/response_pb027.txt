   - Wealth Indicators: Professional affiliation, investment expertise claim

   Psychological Tactics:
   - Trust Building: Extended conversation over time before investment pitch
   - Authority: Claimed professional credentials as investment advisor

   - Sunk Cost Exploitation: Both victims deposited funds and likely continued engagement

   Trust Building Period: "Over time" - suggests weeks to months of interaction (Victim 1)

3. FRAUD MECHANISM
   Platform Type: Fake trading platform (crypto DEX)
   Platform Names: "C2C TG DEX"
   Platform URLs: http://www.TGDEXCustomerService.com

   Fake Profit Shown: Likely yes (implied by trading activity, though not explicitly stated)

   Withdrawal Block Tactics:
   - Complete access blocking (Victim 1)
   - Tax payment demand before withdrawal (Victim 2)

   Notable: The "customer service" domain name suggests professional appearance

   Cryptocurrency Types: Crypto assets (type unspecified in narrative)

   Transaction Hashes: None provided
   Estimated Loss: Not specified in narrative
   Payment Methods: Platform deposit system

   Missing: Specific amounts, crypto types, blockchain addresses

   Timeline suggests:

=== CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT ===

High Confidence Elements (explicit in narrative):
- Telegram as initial contact platform (Victim 1)
- Investment advisor persona
- Platform name and URL
- Withdrawal blocking tactics (access denial, tax demands)
- Platform defunct status

Medium Confidence Elements (strongly implied):
- Trust building tactics
- Authority psychological manipulation
- Fake profit display (common pattern, trading occurred)

Low Confidence/Unknown Elements:
- Specific cryptocurrency types
- Financial loss amounts
- Wallet addresses or transaction details
- Victim 2's initial contact method
- Exact duration of scam
- Communication migration for Victim 2

Overall Confidence Score: 0.75
Reasoning: Clear narrative with explicit details on approach, impersonation, and fraud mechanism, but missing specific financial tracking data and some technical details.

=== NOTABLE PATTERNS ===

1. DEX Branding: Platform branded as "DEX" (Decentralized Exchange) - common legitimacy tactic
2. Customer Service Domain: Domain includes "CustomerService" suggesting professional operation
3. Multiple Victims: At least two victims from same jurisdiction (California)
4. Different Extraction Tactics: Access blocking vs tax demands shows operational flexibility
5. Exit Scam: Platform shut down after extraction, preventing recovery attempts

=== COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ===

Similarities to Other Cases:
- Telegram initial contact (common in pig butchering)
- Investment advisor persona
- Withdrawal blocking with fee/tax demands
- Platform defunct status (exit scam)

Unique Elements:
- "C2C TG DEX" branding (C2C = customer-to-customer, TG = Telegram?)
- CustomerService domain name
- Dual victim reporting with different tactics

=== EXTRACTION DECISIONS ===

For JSON output:
- Case ID: 73 (pb_027)
- Use "crypto_assets_unspecified" for cryptocurrency type
- Mark estimated_loss_usd as null (not provided)
- Include both victims' experiences in withdrawal_block_tactics
- Platform status: "defunct" (explicitly stated)
- List missing information comprehensively
- Confidence score: 0.75

=== CHAIN OF THOUGHT SUMMARY ===

This case demonstrates a classic Pig Butchering operation with:
1. Social engineering through Telegram
2. Trust building with investment advisor persona
3. Professional-appearing platform (DEX branding, customer service domain)
4. Multiple withdrawal blocking tactics
5. Exit scam with platform shutdown

The TTP profile is relatively complete for behavioral analysis but lacks financial tracking details. The multiple victim reports with different experiences provide good insight into the scammers' operational flexibility and extraction tactics.
