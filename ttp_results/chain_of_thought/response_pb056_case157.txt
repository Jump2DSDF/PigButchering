================================================================================
6-STEP FRAUD TTP EXTRACTION FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

STEP 1: INITIAL CONTACT & TRUST ESTABLISHMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis Focus: How did the scammer first make contact and build initial credibility?

Key Observations:
- Initial Contact Method: Social Media (TikTok)
- Trust Vector: Trusted TikTok video creator
- The victim discovered the exchange through content from a TikTok creator they already trusted
- This represents an "influencer exploitation" or "social proof" technique
- No direct personal relationship building mentioned (differentiates from romance scams)

Trust Building Mechanism:
- Parasocial trust relationship with TikTok creator
- Implied legitimacy through association with known content creator
- Platform credibility borrowed from influencer's reputation

TTP Classification:
- Initial Contact Channel: Social Media Platform (TikTok)
- Trust Mechanism: Influencer/Social Proof Exploitation
- Relationship Type: Indirect (through trusted intermediary)

STEP 2: PLATFORM INTRODUCTION & ONBOARDING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis Focus: How was the victim guided onto the fraudulent platform?

Key Observations:
- Fraudulent Platform: leedsbrokerages.com (no longer operational)
- Platform Type: Crypto asset exchange
- Guidance Provided: Representatives from the exchange provided direct assistance
- Technical Onboarding: Victim was guided through:
  * Setting up a crypto wallet
  * Transferring crypto to the exchange

Sophistication Indicators:
- Direct customer support interaction (creates legitimacy impression)
- Step-by-step technical guidance (reduces friction, increases victim comfort)
- Professional appearance of "exchange representatives"

Red Flags (Visible in Hindsight):
- Need for manual guidance suggests non-standard platform
- Representatives directly assisting with wallet setup (unusual for legitimate exchanges)

TTP Classification:
- Platform Type: Fraudulent Crypto Exchange
- Onboarding Support: Direct representative assistance
- Technical Requirements: External wallet setup + platform account

STEP 3: INVESTMENT & ENGAGEMENT PHASE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis Focus: How did scammers maintain engagement and encourage continued investment?

Key Observations:
- Investment Activity: Victim transferred crypto assets to platform
- Account Display: "The resident believed their account balance was steadily growing"
- Duration: Not specified, but implies sustained period of engagement
- Investment Amount: Approximately $30,000 total

Psychological Manipulation Techniques:
- Fake profit display to create illusion of successful investment
- Steady growth pattern to encourage continued holding/investment
- Positive reinforcement through displayed "gains"

Platform Behavior:

- Platform remained accessible during investment phase
- No immediate withdrawal issues during accumulation phase

TTP Classification:
- Profit Display: Fabricated account growth
- Engagement Duration: Extended (sufficient for $30,000 investment)
- Manipulation: Positive reinforcement through fake returns

STEP 4: WITHDRAWAL BLOCKING & ADDITIONAL FEE EXTRACTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis Focus: What barriers were created when victim attempted withdrawal?

Key Observations:
- Withdrawal Trigger: Victim attempted to withdraw funds
- Blocking Mechanism: Demand for additional payments
- Fee Request: Exchange representatives demanded additional payments (specific amount not stated)
- Current Recovery Status: Victim has not recovered any funds

Fee Extraction Pattern:
- Secondary fraud attempt through fabricated fees
- Common pig butchering pattern: taxes, commissions, insurance, etc.
- Creates additional financial damage beyond initial loss

- Maintained illusion that withdrawal possible after payment
- No indication victim actually paid the additional fees

TTP Classification:
- Withdrawal Blocking Method: Additional payment requirement

- Timeline: Platform shutdown occurred after withdrawal denial

Exit Indicators:

Scammer Exit Strategy:
