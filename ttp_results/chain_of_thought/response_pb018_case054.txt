=====================================
6-STEP CHAIN OF THOUGHT TTP ANALYSIS
=====================================

STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE ATTACK VECTOR
-----------------------------------

Primary Attack Vectors Identified:
1. Social Media Recruitment (Facebook)
   - Unsolicited messages from strangers claiming crypto expertise
   - Both victims approached via Facebook messenger
   - Perpetrators posed as successful investors/businesspeople

2. Communication Platform Migration
   - Victim 1: Moved from Facebook to WhatsApp
   - Pattern: Shift to encrypted/private messaging apps
   - Purpose: Avoid platform monitoring and create isolation

3. Social Engineering Personas
   - Victim 1: Generic "crypto investor" persona
   - Victim 2: "Yinan" - detailed backstory (successful business, early retirement plans, uncle with analyst team)
   - Use of proof points (business statements showing returns)

Attack Vector Assessment:
- Initial Contact: Facebook direct messaging
- Relationship Development: WhatsApp for victim 1, likely similar for victim 2
- Trust Building: Success stories, fabricated credentials, false profit demonstrations
- Platform Presentation: Fraudulent crypto trading platform (CBMWW and predecessors)

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:
- T1566.002 - Phishing: Spearphishing Link (social media messaging)
- T1598.003 - Phishing for Information: Social Media
- T1534 - Internal Spearphishing (platform migration)


STEP 2: TRACE THE TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
-------------------------------------------

Domain Infrastructure Analysis:

Chronological Domain Sequence (Based on Victim 1 Report):
1. bittisport.com (earliest domain)
2. nvbit.cc (second iteration)
3. frbit.cc (third iteration)
4. cbmww.com (final/current domain at time of report)

Infrastructure Characteristics:
- Multiple domain migrations suggest infrastructure cycling
- Domain hopping pattern indicates:
  * Evasion of blocklists/takedowns
  * Abuse of different TLDs (.com, .cc)
  * Likely rapid infrastructure turnover

Platform Features (Based on Victim Reports):
- Account creation functionality
- Deposit mechanisms (crypto)
- Fake balance display system
- Withdrawal request interface
- Customer support chat system
- Statement/proof generation capability

Cryptocurrency Wallet Addresses:
- 0xb1ee662001a0247270b282e03cfc0c86642babec
- 0xa5fe0f74911715f5d6290d39da823c8e15986554
- Both appear to be Ethereum addresses (0x prefix, 40 hex characters)

Technical Infrastructure TTPs:
- Domain rotation/cycling for persistence
- Use of .cc TLD (often favored by scammers due to lax registration)
- Fraudulent trading platform mimicking legitimate exchanges
- Fake balance manipulation system
- False withdrawal interface

Current Status:
- All reported websites are no longer operational

Total Investment: $400,000+
Investment Pattern: Progressive deposits over time
Platform Interaction:
- Deposits made to platform
- Funds likely converted to cryptocurrency
- Transferred to scammer-controlled wallets
- Domain changes during investment period suggests:
  * Continued deposits across multiple platform iterations
  * Victim maintained belief despite infrastructure changes

Withdrawal Attempts: Unable to access account before withdrawal possible
Final Outcome: Total loss of $400,000+

Victim 2 Financial Flow:

Phase 1 - Trust Building:
- Initial deposit (amount unspecified)
- First withdrawal: $1,000 (SUCCESSFUL)
- Purpose: Establish platform legitimacy

Phase 2 - Investment Escalation:
- Additional deposits after successful withdrawal
- Total deposits: $179,000+ (possibly more)
- Platform displayed balance: $1,000,000+
- Fake profit display to encourage more deposits

Phase 3 - Extraction Prevention:
- Withdrawal request submitted
- Obstacle introduced: $260,000 "tax" to "Cryptocurrency Regulatory Authority"
- Additional scam layer: "Yinan" offers to pay half ($130,000)
- True objective: Gain access to victim's personal crypto wallet
