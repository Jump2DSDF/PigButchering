================================================================================
6-STEP FRAUD TTP EXTRACTION FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

STEP 1: INITIAL CONTACT & TRUST ESTABLISHMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis Focus: How did the scammer first make contact and build initial credibility?

Key Observations:
- Initial Contact Method: Unsolicited text message
- Scammer Identity: "Sandy" (likely fake persona)
- Contact Pattern: "Stranger" reaching out unprompted
- Progression: Text → WhatsApp migration

Initial Contact Analysis:
- Random text message approach (common pig butchering vector)
- Use of casual, friendly persona name ("Sandy")
- Immediate trust building through general conversation
- No immediate financial discussion (gradual approach)

Platform Migration Strategy:
- Primary Contact: Standard SMS/text messaging
- Secondary Platform: WhatsApp
- Purpose of Migration:
  * More intimate communication environment
  * Harder to monitor/report
  * Better for multimedia sharing
  * Creates sense of special relationship

Relationship Development:
- Narrative states "their relationship developed"
- Implies romantic or deep friendship connection
- Time investment to build emotional bond
- Gradual escalation from stranger to trusted advisor

TTP Classification:
- Initial Contact Channel: Unsolicited SMS/Text Message
- Trust Mechanism: Romantic Relationship Development
- Platform Migration: SMS → WhatsApp
- Relationship Type: Romance/Deep Personal Connection

STEP 2: PLATFORM INTRODUCTION & ONBOARDING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis Focus: How was the victim guided onto the fraudulent platform?

Key Observations:
- Financial Topic Introduction: "At some point, Sandy brought up crypto assets"
- Timing: After relationship established
- Platform Name: Wealth Bax
- Platform URL: h5.wealthbax.com/x/
- Introduction Method: Personal recommendation from "Sandy"

Introduction Timing Analysis:
- Crypto topic introduced AFTER relationship development
- Not immediate (shows patience and planning)
- Presented as helpful investment advice from trusted partner
- Leverages established emotional connection

Onboarding Process:
- Account Opening: Sandy instructed victim to open account
- Fund Transfer: Victim instructed to transfer funds to h5.wealthbax.com/x/
- Personal Information: Victim required to input personal information
- Identity Verification: Picture of driver's license required
- Account Creation: Full registration process

KYC/Identity Collection (CRITICAL):
- Driver's license photo uploaded to fraudulent site
- Personal information collected
- MAJOR PRIVACY/SECURITY CONCERN: Identity theft risk
- Creates false sense of legitimacy ("real" exchanges require ID)
- Scammers now possess victim's identity documents

TTP Classification:
- Platform Type: Fraudulent Crypto Trading Platform
- Platform Name: Wealth Bax (wealthbax.com / h5.wealthbax.com)
- KYC Requirements: Full identity documentation (driver's license)
- PII Collection: Personal information + government ID
- Introduction Vector: Romantic partner recommendation

STEP 3: INVESTMENT & ENGAGEMENT PHASE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis Focus: How did scammers maintain engagement and encourage continued investment?

Key Observations:
- Initial Investment: Victim deposited crypto assets
- Activity: "began trading"
- Relationship Leverage: Sandy offered quid-pro-quo arrangement
- Sandy's Proposal: "If the victim gave her money to help with her family, she in turn would add money to the victim's account"
- Account Display: Platform showed investment worth $281,992

Investment Mechanics:
- Crypto assets deposited (type/amount not specified initially)
- Active trading interface (victim engaged in trading activities)
- Platform provided trading functionality appearance

Sophisticated Manipulation - Quid Pro Quo:
- Sandy requested money "to help with her family"
- Promised to reciprocate by adding money to victim's account
- Creates multiple psychological hooks:
  * Relationship obligation (helping partner's family)
  * Expected reciprocity (she'll help you back)
  * Deepens emotional investment
  * Additional financial extraction beyond platform

Profit Display Mechanics:
- Displayed account value: $281,992
- Massive shown return (likely 10-50x or more of investment)
- Unrealistic gains create strong motivation to "cash out"
- Also creates urgency and fear of losing gains

Psychological Binding:
- Romantic relationship + financial partnership
- Emotional investment (relationship) + Financial investment (money)
- Helper role (assisting Sandy's family)
- Shared success narrative (she's helping you profit too)

TTP Classification:
- Investment Type: Cryptocurrency
- Account Display: Highly inflated fabricated value ($281,992)
- Relationship Leverage: Quid-pro-quo arrangement
- Additional Extraction: Personal financial request (family help)
- Engagement Intensity: High (romantic + financial partnership)

STEP 4: WITHDRAWAL BLOCKING & ADDITIONAL FEE EXTRACTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis Focus: What barriers were created when victim attempted withdrawal?

Key Observations:
- Withdrawal Trigger: Victim attempted to withdraw money
- Blocking Mechanism: Tax payment demand
- Fee Type: "IRS taxes"
- Fee Amount: "more than $40,000"
- Payment Timeline: Not specified
- Fee Justification: Required to release funds

Tax Scam Component:
- Classic pig butchering secondary extraction
- Uses "IRS taxes" to appear legitimate
- Amount: $40,000+ on claimed $281,992 (approximately 14%+)
- Creates believability (governments do tax investment gains)
- Exploits victim's limited knowledge of crypto tax rules

Reality Check:
- Real crypto tax obligations:
  * Paid directly to IRS, not to exchange
  * Not required for withdrawal (calculated at tax filing)
  * Exchange cannot block withdrawal for unpaid taxes
- This is pure fabrication for additional extraction

Sandy's Role in Fee Scam:
- Victim reached out to Sandy about tax demand
- Sandy's response: "pay, and that she had done so too in order to get her money"
- Sandy validates the fake requirement
- Claims she also paid (social proof)
- Maintains trust by seeming to be in same situation
- Encourages compliance with scam

Communication Pattern:
- Sandy remained engaged and responsive
- Continued to play supportive partner role
- Reinforced platform's fake legitimacy
- No indication of abandonment at this stage

Outcome:
- Victim unable to withdraw any funds
- No indication whether victim paid the $40,000 tax demand
- Platform no longer operational

TTP Classification:
- Withdrawal Blocking Method: Fake tax requirement
- Fee Type: "IRS taxes"
- Fee Amount: $40,000+
- Accomplice Validation: Sandy confirmed fake requirement
- Social Proof: Sandy claimed she also paid
- Compliance Result: Unknown if victim paid additional fees
