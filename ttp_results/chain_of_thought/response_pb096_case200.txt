CHAIN OF THOUGHT ANALYSIS: Case PB096 (Original Case ID: 200)
=================================================================

STEP 1: INITIAL CONTACT & TRUST BUILDING
-----------------------------------------
Contact Method: The victim met a stranger online (platform not specified).

Trust Building Tactics:
- Stranger initiated conversation and established rapport with the victim
- Positioned themselves as knowledgeable about cryptocurrency mining opportunities
- Presented the opportunity as a way to "make money from cryptocurrency mining"

Key Observations:
- Initial contact platform is unspecified, suggesting possible dating app, social media, or messaging platform
- Scammer avoided direct investment pressure, framing it as a passive income opportunity through mining
- The liquidity mining angle is a sophisticated variation of pig butchering scams

STEP 2: INTRODUCTION TO FRAUDULENT PLATFORM
--------------------------------------------
Platform Details:
- Primary websites: graphwebtsiplus.com and web3mwy.com
- Full URL: https://www.graphwebtsiplus.com/mining2dex/index.html#/
- Platform Type: Fraudulent cryptocurrency mining/liquidity mining platform

Introduction Method:
- Scammer directly provided website links to the victim
- Positioned the platforms as legitimate liquidity mining opportunities
- Used technical-sounding names ("graph web tsi plus", "mining2dex", "web3") to appear credible

Platform Characteristics:
- Used subdirectory structure (/mining2dex/index.html#/) suggesting a web application
- Web3 branding (web3mwy.com) to leverage DeFi/Web3 trending terminology
- Multiple domain names used, possibly for redundancy or phishing variations

STEP 3: GUIDANCE & INSTRUCTIONAL CONTROL
-----------------------------------------
Scammer Guidance Provided:
- Instructions on how to access an account on the websites
- Detailed steps on how to add funds to the platform
- Instructions on converting crypto assets into platform-specific tokens

Technical Control Elements:
- Victim required to transfer assets from their personal cryptocurrency wallet
- Asset conversion process ensured funds were locked in platform-specific format
- Multi-step process increased victim commitment (sunk cost fallacy)

Psychological Manipulation:
- Step-by-step guidance created dependency on scammer
- Technical complexity made victim feel they needed scammer's expertise
- Conversion requirements obscured the actual movement of victim's funds

STEP 4: FINANCIAL EXTRACTION
-----------------------------
Initial Investment:
- Victim transferred cryptocurrency assets from personal wallet to fraudulent platform
- Specific amounts not disclosed in complaint
- Multiple transfers likely occurred (implied by "add funds" plural reference)

Platform Behavior:
- Platform displayed fabricated profits to the victim
- Interface showed successful mining/liquidity generation
- Fake dashboard created illusion of growing investment

Loss Amount: Not specified in the complaint narrative

Wallet Addresses: None identified in the complaint narrative

STEP 5: WITHDRAWAL DENIAL & EXIT SCAM
--------------------------------------
Withdrawal Attempts:
- Victim attempted to recover their funds
- All withdrawal attempts were blocked or denied
- No specific fees or additional payments mentioned as prerequisites

Exit Strategy:
- Websites became non-operational (both graphwebtsiplus.com and web3mwy.com)
- Complete disappearance of platforms indicates coordinated exit scam
- No customer service or dispute resolution offered

Victim Realization:
- Victim realized they "believed they had made profits" (past tense awareness)
- Unable to recover any funds despite displayed profits
- Recognized the scam when websites went offline

STEP 6: TOTAL IMPACT & INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE
------------------------------------------------
Financial Loss: Amount not specified

Victim Location: California resident

Timeline: Duration not specified, but included multiple interactions and fund transfers

Scam Classification:
1. Pig Butchering Scam - relationship building followed by investment fraud
2. Fraudulent Trading Platform - fake crypto exchange/mining platform
3. Liquidity Mining Scam - specialized crypto scam variant exploiting DeFi trends

Technical Indicators of Compromise:
- graphwebtsiplus.com (primary domain)
- web3mwy.com (secondary domain)
- https://www.graphwebtsiplus.com/mining2dex/index.html#/ (full URL)

Red Flags Present:
1. Unsolicited online contact with investment opportunity
2. Unknown platform not listed on legitimate exchange directories
3. Required asset conversion to platform-specific tokens
4. Displayed unrealistic profits
5. Complete inability to withdraw funds
6. Sudden platform disappearance

Behavioral Patterns:
- Scammer maintained ongoing communication throughout process
- Provided technical guidance to appear legitimate
- Used trending cryptocurrency concepts (Web3, liquidity mining) for credibility
- Exit scam pattern with complete platform shutdown

Additional Context:
- This case represents a sophisticated pig butchering variant targeting crypto-savvy victims
- Liquidity mining angle exploits knowledge of legitimate DeFi yield farming
- Use of multiple domains and technical infrastructure suggests organized crime operation
- Platform shutdown timing suggests either law enforcement detection or planned exit after accumulating sufficient funds
