CHAIN OF THOUGHT ANALYSIS - PB_046 (Case 135)
===============================================
Case: Abnas Global (abnasglobal.cc)
Total Loss: $1,200,000+
Status: HIGH VALUE CASE

INITIAL CONTACT & RELATIONSHIP BUILDING
---------------------------------------
- Initial Contact Vector: WhatsApp and WeChat (multi-platform approach)
- Persona Used: "Tina" (female persona)
- Social Engineering: Built trust through messaging platforms before introducing investment opportunity
- This is a classic "fattening the pig" phase where the scammer establishes rapport

LURING & PLATFORM INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------
- Platform Name: Abnas Global
- Multiple URLs provided:
  * https://www.abnasglobal.com/#/home/modal
  * https://abnasglobal.cc/#/pc/trade
- Investment Type: Bitcoin/crypto asset trading
- Delivery Method: Both web platform and mobile app download
- The use of multiple URLs and app download increases perceived legitimacy

INITIAL INVESTMENT & FAKE PROFITS
----------------------------------
- Victim transferred crypto assets to the platform
- Account showed inflated balance of $2,017,141.86
- This phantom profit is a key psychological hook
- The large "profit" creates urgency and fear of loss when withdrawal is blocked

EXTRACTION TACTICS (SUCCESSIVE DEMANDS)
----------------------------------------
1. First Demand: $240,000 in "taxes"
   - Threat: Assets would be confiscated if not paid
   - This is a common exit scam tactic

2. Negotiation with Tina:
   - Tina offered to "help" by paying some tax
   - Victim only needed to pay $100,000
   - This creates false sense of partnership and reduces perceived risk

3. Second Demand: $160,000 "fine"
   - Another manufactured barrier to withdrawal
   - Again, Tina offered to help by covering part of it
   - Victim paid $140,000 with Tina promising to cover remainder

4. Pattern: Successive extraction through manufactured fees
   - Each demand has a "reason" (tax, fine)
   - Tina's offers to "help" make demands seem more reasonable
   - Victim kept paying hoping to access the phantom $2M balance

OUTCOME
-------
- Total paid: $1,200,000+
- Funds recovered: $0
- Platform status: All sites now defunct
- This is a complete loss scenario with no recovery

TECHNICAL INDICATORS
--------------------
- Multiple domains (.com and .cc TLD)
- Web and mobile app presence
- Platform likely clone of legitimate trading interface
- Sites taken down after extraction completed

BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS
-------------------
- Long-game approach (relationship building)
- Phantom profits to create investment
- Manufactured obstacles to withdrawal
- Accomplice (Tina) provides false support
- Successive demands drain victim systematically
- Exit when victim exhausted or suspicious

KEY TTPS IDENTIFIED
-------------------
1. Multi-platform initial contact (WhatsApp, WeChat)
2. Romantic/friendship social engineering
3. Fake investment platform with multiple entry points
4. Mobile app distribution
5. Phantom profit display
6. Tax/fee withdrawal blocking
7. Accomplice offering to "help" with fees
8. Successive extraction demands
9. Complete exit scam
10. Domain abandonment post-scam

MITRE ATT&CK FRAMEWORK MAPPING
-------------------------------
- Initial Access: Phishing via messaging apps
- Execution: User downloads malicious app
- Persistence: Relationship maintenance
- Defense Evasion: Multiple domains, app-based delivery
- Credential Access: Account creation on fake platform
- Collection: Crypto asset deposits
- Impact: Financial theft, resource hijacking

SOPHISTICATION LEVEL: HIGH
---------------------------
- Professional platform design
- Multi-channel approach
- Coordinated accomplice role
- Sophisticated social engineering
- Systematic extraction strategy
- $1.2M+ loss indicates sustained operation

PREVENTION OPPORTUNITIES MISSED
--------------------------------
1. Platform verification (both domains unregistered/illegitimate)
2. Tax payment red flag (legitimate platforms don't demand external tax payments)
3. Fine payment red flag (manufactured obstacles)
4. Third party "help" red flag (Tina's involvement in fee payments)
5. Inability to withdraw should have triggered immediate cessation
