STEP 1: INITIAL CONTACT & TRUST BUILDING
-----------------------------------------
This case involves TWO SEPARATE VICTIMS with similar but distinct experiences.

VICTIM 1 - Facebook/WhatsApp Relationship Scam:
Attack Vector: Social media (Facebook Messenger)
- Initial contact through Facebook Messenger
- Progressed to WhatsApp for ongoing communication
- Victim "met someone" online (implies relationship building)
- Scammer claimed to be male ("his uncle")
- Romantic or friendship relationship implied

Relationship Building:
- Extended conversations across multiple platforms
- Development of personal relationship/friendship
- Scammer shared personal investment story (investing in gold)
- Created family backstory (uncle as investment advisor)
- Built trust through consistent communication
- Transition from Facebook to WhatsApp indicates deepening relationship

VICTIM 2 - Direct Professional Contact:
Attack Vector: Phone call
- Victim received call from "Lee"
- Professional approach (investment opportunity)
- No social media relationship building phase
- Direct business/investment framing

Lee's Persona:
- Professional investment advisor persona
- Gold investment expertise
- Persistent communication and guidance
- Mentor/advisor relationship rather than romantic

Key Differences Between Victims:
- Victim 1: Social media romance/friendship approach
- Victim 2: Direct professional cold-call approach
- Both led to same fraudulent platform (SAXO Group)
- Different personas, same criminal infrastructure

CONCLUSION:
-----------
Case 64 represents one of the most sophisticated and financially devastating pig butchering scams in this dataset. The operation demonstrates criminal enterprise-level organization with multiple victim acquisition vectors, unified fraudulent infrastructure, and advanced psychological manipulation. The impersonation of legitimate Saxo Bank adds credibility and complicates victim awareness. The massive financial extraction from Victim 2 ($1,572,870.63) demonstrates expert-level manipulation and progressive escalation over an extended period. The tax scam withdrawal barrier represents an advanced final extraction tactic that exploits sunk cost fallacy to extract additional funds beyond the initial investment. The multi-platform approach (Facebook, WhatsApp, phone) and diverse personas show sophisticated victim targeting and relationship management capabilities. This case exemplifies the evolution of pig butchering scams toward more sophisticated brand impersonation and higher-value victim targeting.
