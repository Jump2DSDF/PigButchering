=================================================
Case ID: pb081 (Original Case ID: 183)
Primary Subject: bravehqnx.cc (Entity Impersonating Brave Software)
Analysis Date: 2025-12-17

STEP 1: CASE UNDERSTANDING & INITIAL CONTACT
---------------------------------------------
Scam Type Classification:
- Fraudulent Trading Platform
- Imposter Scam
- Pig Butchering Scam

Initial Contact Method:
The narrative does not explicitly detail the initial contact method, but victims were convinced to engage with the fraudulent platform. The scam leverages impersonation tactics, suggesting initial outreach may have occurred through social media, crypto forums, or direct messaging platforms where the scammers posed as representatives of Brave Software.

Victim Profile:
- Cryptocurrency investors, particularly those interested in Ethereum (ETH)
- Individuals seeking legitimate cryptocurrency staking and mining opportunities
- Users familiar with Brave browser/ecosystem who may trust the brand

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP BUILDING & TRUST ESTABLISHMENT
---------------------------------------------------
Trust Building Tactics:
1. Brand Impersonation: Fraudulent company poses as Brave Software, a legitimate and well-known privacy-focused browser company with its own cryptocurrency (BAT - Basic Attention Token)
2. Professional Website Design: Created a deceptive website (bravehqnx.cc) that closely mimics Brave's official branding, logo, color scheme, and design elements
3. Legitimate Business Association: Exploited the reputation and trust associated with Brave Software to lower victim skepticism
4. Promise of High Returns: Offered alleged cryptocurrency investment opportunities with claims of high returns from crypto-mining or staking activities
5. Technical Legitimacy: Focused on Ethereum (ETH), a major cryptocurrency, adding perceived legitimacy to the operation

Duration and Interaction:
The narrative indicates ongoing communication through the fraudulent platform's customer support and emails, suggesting a sustained interaction period where victims believed they were dealing with legitimate customer service representatives.

STEP 3: PLATFORM/INVESTMENT INTRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------
Platform Details:
- Website: bravehqnx.cc (now non-operational)
- Impersonated Entity: Brave Software (legitimate company at brave.com)
- Confused With: Brave Wallet service (https://brave.com/wallet/)

Investment Opportunity Presented:
1. Cryptocurrency Investment: Focused on Ethereum (ETH) and potentially other cryptocurrencies
2. Staking Activities: Promised returns from crypto staking mechanisms
3. Mining Operations: Claimed profits from crypto-mining activities
4. High Returns: Advertised significant profit potential to attract investors

Platform Features (Fraudulent):
- Professional-looking interface mimicking Brave Software's design
- Customer support system (email and platform-based)
- Account management system for deposits and tracking
- Mining/staking dashboard (likely showing fake returns)

STEP 4: INVESTMENT/DEPOSIT PHASE
---------------------------------
Fund Transfer Methods:
Users were convinced to transfer their ETH or other cryptocurrencies to wallet addresses controlled by the fraudulent company. This indicates:
- Direct cryptocurrency wallet transfers
- Use of specific wallet addresses controlled by scammers
- Victims sent funds believing they were depositing into legitimate Brave Software investment accounts

Investment Pattern:
The narrative suggests multiple victims were affected, with users transferring various amounts of cryptocurrency (primarily ETH). The specific amounts are not detailed, but the phrase "significant financial losses" indicates substantial sums were involved.

Wallet Addresses:
While specific wallet addresses are not provided in the complaint narrative, the scam involved directing victims to transfer cryptocurrencies to scammer-controlled wallet addresses. These addresses would be critical for blockchain analysis and tracking stolen funds.

STEP 5: MANIPULATION & WITHDRAWAL BARRIERS

Continued Engagement:
Victims maintained communication with the fraudulent platform's customer support and email system, attempting to:
1. Track their investments
2. Request withdrawals
