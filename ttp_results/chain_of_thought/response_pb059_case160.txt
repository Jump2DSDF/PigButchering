================================================================================
6-STEP FRAUD TTP EXTRACTION FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

STEP 1: INITIAL CONTACT & TRUST ESTABLISHMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis Focus: How did the scammer first make contact and build initial credibility?

Key Observations:
- Initial Discovery: "Victim reports discovering a crypto asset investment group online"
- Group Leader: "Professor" Robert
- Leadership Structure: Robert (professor) + Angelina (assistant)
- Platform: Online (specific platform not stated)
- Value Proposition: "People were making revenue of 20 to 30% from their investments"

Initial Contact Analysis:
- Investment group discovery (similar to Case 58, but different platform)
- No mention of how victim found group (organic search? advertisement? invitation?)
- "Discovered" suggests victim-initiated rather than scammer-initiated contact
- Educational/professional framing (professor as leader)

Authority Figure - "Professor" Robert:
- Title: "Professor" (academic authority positioning)
- Role: Investment group leader
- Credibility Mechanism: Academic/intellectual authority
- Activity: Created trading platform for group
- Expertise: Crypto asset investing and trading

Trust Building Mechanisms:
- Academic authority (professor title)
- Reported success (members making 20-30% returns)
- Community structure (group of investors)
- Professional assistant (Angelina supporting operations)
- Social proof (allegedly multiple successful members)

Performance Claims:
- ROI: 20-30% returns
- Credibility: Specific percentage range (seems believable, not too extreme)
- Social Proof: "People were making" (implies multiple successful participants)
- Comparison: More conservative than Case 57's extreme gains (more believable)

TTP Classification:
- Initial Contact Channel: Online (platform unspecified)
- Discovery Method: Victim-initiated (found group online)
- Trust Mechanism: Academic Authority (Professor) + Performance Claims
- Scam Variant: Investment Group Scam
- Group Structure: Leader (Robert) + Assistant (Angelina) + Members

STEP 2: PLATFORM INTRODUCTION & ONBOARDING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis Focus: How was the victim guided onto the fraudulent platform?

Key Observations:
- Platform Name: SILD
- Platform Creator: Robert (the professor)
- Platform URL: sildgroup.co
- Secondary Domain: sild.us
- Platform Purpose: "Trading platform where the entire group would trade together"
- Onboarding Guide: Angelina (Robert's assistant)

Platform Introduction Strategy:
- Group-specific platform (created by trusted leader Robert)
- Exclusive to group members (community-based)

- Creates sense of special access and membership

Robert's Dual Role:
- Group Leader: Provides education, leadership, strategy
- Platform Creator: Built the trading infrastructure
- Significance: Complete control over both community and platform
- Red Flag: Group leader controlling the trading platform (conflict of interest)

Angelina's Role - Critical Actor:
- Title: Robert's assistant
- Function: Technical onboarding and support

- Duration: Sufficient to build trust for tier 2 proposition

First Platform Experience:

- Creates foundation for escalation to "exclusive" tier

TTP Classification - Tier 1:
- Platform: SILD standard group trading

- New Platform: "More exclusive trading platform"
- Investment Range: "$50,000 to $3 million"

Exclusive Tier Characteristics:

- Scarcity/exclusivity creates desire

Psychological Manipulation - Initial Rejection:

- Exclusivity Tactic: Initial rejection due to insufficient funds
- Investment Requirement: $50,000 - $3,000,000
- Platform Type: Exclusive/premium trading platform
- Psychological Hook: Scarcity and exclusivity

STEP 5: PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP LEVERAGE - ANGELINA'S DIRECT ENGAGEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Observations:
- Actor Shift: Angelina reached out to victim via WhatsApp

- Encouragement: "Try to join the new group"

Angelina's Strategic Outreach:

- Exciting news delivery (investment tripled)
- Encouragement and support

Fabricated Performance Claims:
- Investment tripled in two weeks
- Timeframe: 2 weeks (rapid gains)

- Actor: Angelina (assistant becomes primary manipulator)
- Channel: WhatsApp (personal messaging)
- Tactic: Personal outreach with exciting performance news
- Fabricated Returns: 300% in two weeks
- Goal: Encourage exclusive tier participation

STEP 6: FINANCIAL EXTRACTION - ESCALATING COMMITMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis Focus: Progressive extraction and commitment escalation

EXTRACTION PHASE 1 - Initial Attempt:
- Victim Response: "I have $50,000 in the bank"
- Angelina's Response: "All the $50,000 slots were taken"
- New Requirement: "$100,000" needed to join
- Scarcity Tactic: Lower tier slots "taken" (creates urgency)

EXTRACTION PHASE 2 - Partnership Offer:
- Angelina's Proposal: "Victim should try to get as much money as possible"
- Angelina's Promise: "She would kick in the rest to get to $100,000"
- Partnership Framing: Angelina helping victim access opportunity
- Creates sense of:
  * Partnership and shared investment
  * Angelina's personal financial commitment
  * Special relationship and insider help
  * Obligation to maximize contribution

EXTRACTION PHASE 3 - Bank Resistance:
- Victim Action: Went to bank to liquidate $50,000 CD
- Bank Response: "Wouldn't allow the transfer"
- Bank Reasoning: "Platform appeared to be suspicious"
- Critical Moment: Bank identified fraud indicators
- Victim Response: Proceeded anyway with alternative method

EXTRACTION PHASE 4 - Direct Transfer to Scammer:
- Method 1: "Sent the funds directly to Angela" [$50,000]
- Note: Name spelling change (Angelina → Angela, likely same person)
- Bypass: Circumvented bank's platform transfer block
- Method 2: "Sent $25,000 to Angelina's crypto wallet"
- Total Direct Transfers: $75,000 to scammer personally

Additional Context:
- Total Investment: "More than $85,000"
- Implies: $75,000 direct + additional platform deposits
- Bank Warning: Ignored despite bank flagging platform as suspicious

Critical Analysis:
- Bank performed protective function (refused transfer)
- Victim circumvented protection by sending directly to scammer
- Direct personal transfers (not to platform) are major red flag
- Scammer willingness to receive direct personal transfers shows desperation and exit intent
- Multiple transfer methods: Direct + crypto wallet

TTP Classification - Extraction:
- Tier Access Fee: $100,000 claimed requirement
- Scarcity Tactic: Lower amounts "sold out"
- Partnership Fraud: Angelina's false promise to "kick in the rest"
- Bank Intervention: Bank blocked platform transfer (protective action)
- Circumvention: Victim sent funds directly to scammer
- Direct Transfer 1: $50,000 to Angela/Angelina
- Direct Transfer 2: $25,000 to Angelina's crypto wallet
- Total Documented Loss: $85,000+

STEP 7: EXIT STRATEGY & PLATFORM SHUTDOWN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis Focus: How did the scam terminate?

Key Observations:
- Platform Status: "Website is no longer operational"
- Fund Recovery: "Has not been able to recover any of their money"
- Total Loss: More than $85,000
- Direct Scammer Transfers: $75,000 ($50k + $25k)

Exit Indicators:
- Complete platform shutdown
- No recovery possible
- Both domains (sildgroup.co and sild.us) offline

Scammer Direct Receipt of Funds:
- Highly unusual in pig butchering (typically platform-only transfers)
- $50,000 direct transfer to "Angela"
- $25,000 to Angelina's crypto wallet
- Suggests either:
  * Exit scam in progress (grabbing direct funds before shutdown)
  * Extreme boldness/desperation
  * Victim so deeply manipulated that direct transfers seemed reasonable

Evidence Available:
- Screenshot URL: "https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_spam310-redacted.jpg"
- Local Screenshot: "pig_butchering_cases\\screenshots\\pb_059_case_160.jpg"
- Screenshot labeled "spam" (possibly spam message or flagged communication)
- Redacted (PII removed from evidence)

Critical Teaching Moment:
- Bank intervention occurred but victim proceeded anyway
- Shows powerful psychological manipulation overcame institutional warning
- Direct transfers to individual scammers (not platform) are extreme red flags
- Victim sent more than $85,000 despite explicit bank warning

TTP Classification - Exit:
- Exit Method: Platform shutdown
- Platform Status: Offline (both domains)
- Direct Scammer Enrichment: $75,000 in personal/wallet transfers
- Total Victim Loss: $85,000+
- Recovery: $0
- Bank Warning: Present but ignored by victim
