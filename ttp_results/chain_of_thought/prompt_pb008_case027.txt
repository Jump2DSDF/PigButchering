You are a digital forensics expert specializing in cryptocurrency fraud analysis. Your task is to extract structured TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) information from a Pig Butchering scam complaint narrative.

## Task
Analyze the following victim complaint and extract fraud intelligence using a systematic Chain of Thought approach.

## Input
**Case ID:** 27
**Primary Subject:** Up-Business
http://up-business.top
up-business.business
**Scam Type:** Pig Butchering Scam

Fraudulent Trading Platform
**Website:** http://up-business.top/
http://up-business.business/
**Complaint Narrative:**
Two California residents reported about their experiences investing on the crypto asset trading platform Up-Business. The first victim was approached by “Raddy” on Facebook who suggested they continue their conversations on WhatsApp. Over time, Raddy began introducing the resident to crypto asset trading and eventually convinced the resident to invest with Raddy on the trading platform, located at the website up-business.top. Raddy convinced the victim they used an AI trading program that would generate stable returns. Following Raddy’s instructions the victim invested funds on the platform and believed they were earning substantial profits on the platform. But when the victim tried to withdraw funds from the platform, they were not able to. All told the victim lost more than $55,000 on the platform. The resident reported sending crypto to 0xB10ABECA64cf19d37c45045a5851BB528fB21E47. 

The second victim was approached by “Reddy” on WhatsApp who convinced them to  create an account and transfer funds to a crypto asset trading platform located at up-business.business. Reddy convinced the victim they could earn profits with an AI-based crypto asset trading program, but they needed to make a minimum of five trades. The victim made the five trades and believed they had made a profit on the platform. But when the victim tried to withdraw funds, the platform’s customer support demanded they deposit additional funds and engage in five more trades first. Reddy encouraged the victim to do this, and soon the victim believed their account had grown to more than $100,000. But when the victim tried to withdraw funds again, the platform demanded they pay 10% of the withdrawal before it would release the funds. The victim has been unable to recover any funds and the platform is no longer operational.

## Chain of Thought Analysis

Please follow these steps explicitly and document your reasoning for each:

### Step 1: Initial Contact Analysis (접근 및 유인)
Think through:
- How did the victim first encounter the scammer?
- What platform was used for initial contact?
- Was there a migration to another communication platform?
- What type of lure was used (romance, investment opportunity, etc.)?

### Step 2: Persona & Psychology Analysis (사칭 및 심리)
Think through:
- What identity did the scammer claim?
- What wealth or success indicators were shown?
- What type of relationship was established?
- What psychological manipulation tactics are evident?
- How long was the trust-building phase?

### Step 3: Fraud Mechanism Analysis (사기 수법)
Think through:
- What type of fraudulent platform was used?
- What was the platform name and URL?
- Were fake profits shown to the victim?
- What tactics were used to block withdrawals?

### Step 4: Financial Intelligence Extraction (추적단서)
Think through:
- What cryptocurrencies were involved?
- Are any wallet addresses mentioned?
- Are any transaction hashes mentioned?
- What was the estimated total loss?
- What payment methods were used?

### Step 5: Temporal Analysis (시간적 지표)
Think through:
- How long did the scam last?
- Is the fraudulent platform still operational?

### Step 6: Confidence Assessment
Think through:
- What information was clearly stated vs. inferred?
- What important information is missing?
- Overall confidence in this extraction?

## Output Format

## Important Guidelines
1. Only extract information explicitly stated or strongly implied in the narrative
2. Use "unknown" or null for information not available
3. Be conservative with confidence scores
4. Document all reasoning in the chain_of_thought section
5. For arrays, include all relevant items found
6. Normalize wallet addresses and URLs as found in the text
