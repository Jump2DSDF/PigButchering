TTP CHAIN OF THOUGHT ANALYSIS
Case: pb_025 (case 68)
Platform: CBOTBIT (cbotbit.com)

================================================================================
CASE NARRATIVE
================================================================================
A California resident met "Lin" through WhatsApp who steered the conversation
to investing in crypto assets. Lin directed the victim to the crypto asset
trading platform, CBOTBIT, located at https://cbotbit.com and showed them how
to open an account and transfer funds. Following Lin's instructions for trading,
the victim believed their account had grown substantially. But when the victim
tried to withdraw funds from the platform, they were unable to do so. The
website is no longer operational. All told, the victim believed they lost more
than $40,000.

================================================================================
STEP 1: INITIAL CONTACT ANALYSIS (접근 및 유인)
================================================================================

Initial Contact Platform:
- IDENTIFIED: WhatsApp
- Evidence: "A California resident met 'Lin' through WhatsApp"
- Confidence: HIGH - explicitly stated

Lure Type:
- IDENTIFIED: Investment opportunity
- Evidence: Lin "steered the conversation to investing in crypto assets"
- Pattern: Classic pig butchering progression from initial contact to investment
- Confidence: HIGH - clear from narrative

Communication Migration:
- ASSESSMENT: No migration evident
- Evidence: No mention of moving to another platform
- Likely scenario: Communications remained on WhatsApp throughout
- Confidence: MEDIUM - based on absence of contrary information

Attack Vector Assessment:
This appears to be either:
1. Random/targeted outreach on WhatsApp, OR
2. Contact initiated through another platform then moved to WhatsApp
The narrative doesn't specify how they "met" on WhatsApp initially.

================================================================================
STEP 2: PERSONA & PSYCHOLOGY ANALYSIS (사칭 및 심리)

- Assessment: Lin positioned as knowledgeable/successful trader rather than
  displaying obvious wealth
- Confidence: LOW - speculative

Relationship Type:
- IDENTIFIED: Investment advisor / Mentor
- Evidence: "showed them how to open an account and transfer funds"

   - Pattern: Fake gains serve as proof that Lin's method works
   - Confidence: MEDIUM

4. SUNK COST EXPLOITATION
   - Evidence: Victim deposited "more than $40,000" total
   - Pattern: Likely multiple deposits following initial success

     investing more to capitalize on apparent opportunity
   - Confidence: MEDIUM

5. FEAR OF MISSING OUT (FOMO)

================================================================================
STEP 3: FRAUD MECHANISM ANALYSIS (사기 수법)
================================================================================

Platform Type:
- IDENTIFIED: Fake trading platform
- Evidence: "crypto asset trading platform, CBOTBIT"
- Confidence: HIGH

Platform Details:
- NAME: CBOTBIT
- URL: https://cbotbit.com
- Confidence: HIGH - explicitly stated

Fake Profit Display:
- CONFIRMED: YES
- Evidence: "the victim believed their account had grown substantially"
- Pattern: Classic pig butchering technique showing fake returns
- Purpose: Encourage continued deposits and prevent early withdrawal attempts
- Confidence: HIGH

Withdrawal Block Tactics:
- OUTCOME: Complete withdrawal failure
- Evidence: "when the victim tried to withdraw funds from the platform, they
  were unable to do so"
- SPECIFIC TACTICS: Not detailed in narrative
- Common scenarios for this pattern:
  * Platform interface prevents withdrawal function

  * Support unresponsive to withdrawal requests
- Confidence: HIGH that blocking occurred, LOW on specific method

Platform Status:
- CURRENT STATUS: Defunct
- Evidence: "The website is no longer operational"
- Pattern: Typical exit scam - platform shuts down after collecting funds
- Confidence: HIGH

Technical Assessment:
- The cbotbit.com domain represents a fake exchange impersonating legitimate
  trading infrastructure
- No indication of app vs. web-based platform
- No screenshots or technical indicators mentioned

================================================================================
STEP 4: FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE EXTRACTION (추적단서)
================================================================================

Cryptocurrency Types:
- MENTIONED: "crypto assets" (generic term)
- SPECIFIC TYPES: Not specified
- LIKELY CANDIDATES: BTC, ETH, USDT (most common in pig butchering)
- Confidence: LOW - no specific information

Wallet Addresses:
- IDENTIFIED: None
- Assessment: Critical gap for blockchain tracking
- Confidence: N/A - information not present

Transaction Hashes:
- IDENTIFIED: None
- Assessment: Critical gap for blockchain tracking
- Confidence: N/A - information not present

Estimated Total Loss:
- AMOUNT: More than $40,000 USD
- PRECISION: Minimum threshold, actual amount may be higher
- Evidence: "the victim believed they lost more than $40,000"
- Confidence: HIGH for minimum estimate

Payment Methods:

- Confidence: LOW - speculative

Deposit Pattern Analysis:
- NUMBER OF DEPOSITS: Not specified
- AMOUNTS: Not specified
- PROGRESSION: Likely escalating (typical pattern)
- Evidence of multiple deposits: Total of $40k+ suggests multiple transactions
  rather than single deposit
- Confidence: MEDIUM - based on typical patterns

Critical Intelligence Gaps:
1. No wallet addresses = cannot trace funds on blockchain
2. No transaction hashes = cannot identify specific transfers
3. No cryptocurrency types = cannot focus blockchain analysis
4. No deposit timeline = cannot correlate with platform operations
5. No bank information = cannot trace initial fiat on-ramp

================================================================================
STEP 5: TEMPORAL ANALYSIS (시간적 지표)

Scam Duration:
- START: Not specified
- END: Not specified
- TOTAL DURATION: Unknown

OVERALL CONFIDENCE SCORE: 0.75

RATIONALE:
- Core facts clearly stated: platform URL, name, loss amount, contact method
- Strong narrative consistency with known pig butchering patterns
- Significant gaps in technical/forensic intelligence
- Minimal detail on scammer persona and psychological manipulation specifics
- No blockchain tracking information whatsoever

INTELLIGENCE VALUE:
- URL (cbotbit.com) can be checked for historical data, DNS records, hosting
- Name "Lin" adds to pattern database but limited actionable value
- Loss amount confirms high-value target
- WhatsApp as platform consistent with Asian-origin scam operations
- Pattern matches classic investment-type pig butchering

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FOLLOW-UP:
1. OSINT on cbotbit.com domain (WHOIS, historical snapshots, DNS)
2. Request victim's transaction records from legitimate exchanges used
3. Request bank records showing fiat-to-crypto conversions
4. Request WhatsApp communication logs with Lin
5. Search for other victims of cbotbit.com platform
6. Check if victim has screenshots of platform or communications
7. Determine if victim has any wallet addresses used for transfers
8. Cross-reference "Lin" with other reported pig butchering cases
