================================================

Platform: Trus Flow (trusflow.com)
Analysis Date: 2025-12-17

STEP 1: INITIAL CONTACT & TRUST BUILDING
-----------------------------------------
Platform/Channel: LinkedIn (initial contact) -> WhatsApp (communication)
Approach Method: Professional networking leading to private messaging with investment opportunity
Social Engineering Tactics:
  - Initial contact through professional network (LinkedIn)
  - Migration to private messaging app (WhatsApp)
  - Friendly conversation building rapport
  - Suggestion of earning opportunity through crypto trading

Initial Hook: "Earning money by crypto trading" presented as friendly suggestion

Contact Pattern:
  - Met on LinkedIn (professional context)
  - Invited to chat on WhatsApp (private channel)
  - Built relationship before introducing investment opportunity
  - Positioned as friend/advisor rather than salesperson

STEP 2: PLATFORM INTRODUCTION & SMALL WINS
-------------------------------------------
Fraudulent Platform: Trus Flow (trusflow.com)
Platform URLs:
  - https://www.trusflow.com/#/
  - https://www.trusflow.com/
  - https://www.trusflow.com
  - trusflow.com

Platform Type: Fraudulent crypto trading platform
Platform Status: No longer operational

Educational Component:
  - Contact "taught" victim how to exchange cash for crypto
  - Guided on transferring funds to the site for trading
  - Created appearance of legitimate instruction and expertise

Initial Investment Strategy:
  - Victim tested platform with $1,000
  - Small test amount allowed to build confidence
  - Victim "believed they had made a profit" on initial investment

Fabricated Success:
  - Initial $1,000 test showed profit
  - Encouraged continued deposits over couple of months
  - Account allegedly grew to nearly $500,000 in profit
  - False profits displayed to encourage further investment

STEP 3: INVESTMENT ESCALATION
------------------------------
Total Investment: Over $300,000 (not including fees)

Investment Pattern:
  - Started with $1,000 test investment
  - Successful initial test encouraged more deposits
  - Deposits made over a couple of months
  - Progressive investment based on displayed profits
  - Account showed nearly $500,000 in profits

Timeline: Couple of months of active trading and deposits

Psychological Manipulation:
  - Initial small success built confidence
  - Display of massive fake profits (nearly $500,000)
  - Gradual investment escalation over time
  - Contact providing continuous guidance and support
  - Illusion of legitimate trading platform

STEP 4: WITHDRAWAL BARRIERS & FEE EXTRACTION
---------------------------------------------
This case demonstrates an extreme progressive fee extraction scheme:

Barrier 1 - Large Volume Trading Commission:
  - Fee Demanded: $100,000
  - Justification: "Large volume trading commission" required before withdrawal
  - Outcome: PAID by victim

Barrier 2 - Green Channel Fee:
  - Fee Demanded: $100,000
  - Justification: "Green channel fee" to expedite withdrawal
  - Promise: Would be refunded to victim later
  - Outcome: PAID by victim

Barrier 3 - Security Deposit:
  - Fee Demanded: $75,000
  - Justification: "Security deposit" required
  - Promise: Would also be refunded
  - Outcome: Demanded but payment status unclear

Fee Extraction Tactics:
  - Massive fee demands ($100,000 per fee)
  - False promises of refunds to justify payment
  - Progressive barrier creation
  - Each payment led to new fee requirement
  - Total fee demands: $275,000 ($100,000 + $100,000 + $75,000)
  - Fees comparable to or exceeding original investment

Total Fees Paid: At minimum $200,000 (first two fees)
Total Loss: Over $300,000 (not recovered)

STEP 5: FINAL EXTRACTION & EXIT
--------------------------------
Final Status:
  - Total loss: Over $300,000
  - No funds recovered
  - Contact cut off all communication
  - Website is no longer operational
  - Victim completely ghosted

Exit Strategy:
  - Progressive fee extraction until victim exhausted or suspicious
  - Complete communication cutoff by LinkedIn contact
  - Website shutdown
  - No recourse for victim

Communication Termination:
  - LinkedIn contact ceased all communication
  - Victim abandoned after extraction complete
  - WhatsApp contact likely blocked or deleted

Impact:
  - Total financial loss exceeds $300,000
  - Loss includes both investments and massive fraudulent fees
  - Complete ghosting and platform shutdown
  - No possibility of recovery
