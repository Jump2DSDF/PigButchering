CHAIN OF THOUGHT ANALYSIS - PIG BUTCHERING CASE
Case ID: pb_case_id 92 (original_case_id 196)
Platform: Hagradg.cc (pc.hagradg.cc)
Date of Analysis: 2025-12-17

================================================================================
STEP 1: INITIAL CONTACT & TRUST BUILDING
================================================================================

Contact Method Analysis:
- The narrative does not specify how the victim initially discovered the platform
- Accessed through "an app on their phone" indicating:
  * Mobile application distribution
  * Possible app store presence (legitimate or sideloaded)
  * Mobile-first platform design
  * Suggests targeted distribution or advertising

Platform Discovery:
- Victim "reported a trading platform they accessed through an app"
- URL: https://pc.hagradg.cc/#/?from=/user (web-based interface)
- Subdomain "pc" (personal computer) with mobile app suggests multi-platform
- Domain extension ".cc" (Cocos Islands) - common for scam operations

Trust Building Elements:
- Professional mobile application
- Multi-asset trading offering (forex, metal, oil, CFD, crypto)
- Diverse market access suggesting legitimacy
- Web interface accessible via URL

Key Observation: The mobile app vector is significant - it suggests either:
1. App store distribution (if approved, adds false legitimacy)
2. APK/IPA sideloading (if direct download, requires more trust building)
3. Progressive Web App (PWA) installation

================================================================================
STEP 2: PLATFORM INTRODUCTION & ONBOARDING
================================================================================

Platform Characteristics:
- Primary access: Mobile app on victim's phone
- Web interface: https://pc.hagradg.cc/#/?from=/user
- Domain structure:
  * Primary: hagradg.cc
  * Subdomain for web: pc.hagradg.cc
  * Hash routing suggests single-page application

Asset Classes Offered:
1. Forex (Foreign Exchange)
2. Metals trading
3. Oil commodities
4. CFD (Contracts for Difference)
5. Cryptocurrency

Onboarding Process:
- Account registration through mobile app (implied)
- Initial deposit capability
- Trading interface access
- Dashboard showing multiple market options

Red Flags (in hindsight):
- Unusual domain extension (.cc)
- URL parameter "?from=/user" may indicate referral tracking
- Too many diverse asset classes (overextended offerings)
- Mobile app without established brand recognition

================================================================================
STEP 3: INVESTMENT & ENGAGEMENT PHASE
================================================================================

Initial Investment:
- First deposit: $100 (small initial investment)
- Low barrier to entry typical of scam platforms
- Allows victim to "test the waters"
- Builds confidence with minimal initial risk

Account Growth Pattern:
- Initial balance: $100
- Reported balance growth: "over $1,500"
- Growth rate: 1,400%+ increase
- Timeframe: Not specified but likely short-term

Analysis of Growth:
- Unrealistic returns (14x initial investment)
- Fake profits displayed on dashboard
- No actual trading occurred (all simulated)
- Growth designed to:
  * Build confidence
  * Create emotional investment
  * Encourage larger deposits
  * Trigger withdrawal attempt

Victim Psychology During This Phase:
- Excitement over apparent profits
- Belief in platform legitimacy
- Growing trust based on visible "success"
- Anticipation of accessing profits
- No awareness of fraud at this point

Key Indicator: The dramatic account growth from $100 to $1,500+ is a classic
pig butchering tactic to hook the victim and encourage them to either:
1. Deposit more funds
2. Attempt withdrawal (triggering next phase)

================================================================================
STEP 4: PROFIT DISPLAY & MANIPULATION
================================================================================

Fake Profit Generation:
- Starting balance: $100
- Displayed profit: ~$1,400+ (over $1,500 total)
- Percentage gain: 1,400%+
- Display method: Trading dashboard/app interface

Trading Simulation:
- Platform likely showed:
  * Successful trades across multiple markets
  * Real-time price feeds (potentially legitimate data)
  * Account balance updates
  * Profit/loss statements
  * Trade history
- All trading activity was fabricated
- No actual market orders placed

Multi-Market Display Strategy:
- Showing trading across forex, metals, oil, CFD, crypto
- Created impression of sophisticated trading activity
- Diversification appeared professional
- Complexity added perceived legitimacy

Psychological Hooks:
- Visible profit growth maintained engagement
- Success validated initial decision to invest
- Created sunk-cost fallacy (emotional investment)
- Anticipated access to profits
- No warning signs visible to victim

================================================================================
STEP 5: WITHDRAWAL DENIAL & FEE EXTORTION
================================================================================

The Critical Turning Point - Withdrawal Attempt:
- Victim attempted to withdraw funds (likely the full $1,500+)
- Withdrawal was not immediately processed
- Platform demanded additional payment

Fee Extortion Demand:
- Required deposit: $900 additional
- Justification: "to release their funds"
- Common scam tactic: pay-to-unlock
- Fee amount: 60% of displayed balance (substantial)
- Creates financial pressure and confusion

Mathematical Analysis:
- Original investment: $100
- Displayed balance: $1,500+
- Demanded fee: $900
- If victim paid: Total invested = $1,000
- Net position if paid: -$1,000 (total loss)

Victim Response:
- Victim "complained to the platform about this"
- Indicates:
  * Recognition that fee was unusual
  * Attempt to resolve through communication
  * Some skepticism about legitimacy
  * Hope that complaint would resolve issue

Platform's Retaliation - Account Lockout:
- "Promptly locked out of their account"
- Immediate response to complaint
- Punitive action
- Cut off all communication
- Eliminated further negotiation

Exit Scam Execution:
- Complete loss of account access
- No recovery of original $100
- No access to displayed $1,500
- $900 fee not paid (victim avoided further loss)
- Website "no longer in operation"

Financial Impact:
- Direct loss: $100 (initial deposit)
- Avoided additional loss: $900 (fee not paid)
- Total loss: $100
- Fake profits lost: $1,400+
- Recovery: None successful

================================================================================

Infrastructure Analysis:

Domain Information:

Attribution Indicators:

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This case demonstrates a sophisticated fraudulent trading platform operation
with several notable characteristics:

1. MOBILE APPLICATION VECTOR: Unusual deployment via mobile app suggests either:
   - App store distribution (requires bypassing review processes)
   - Direct APK/IPA distribution (requires victim trust)
   - Progressive Web App (hybrid approach)

2. LOW BARRIER TO ENTRY: $100 minimum investment casts wide net for victims

3. EXTREME PROFIT DISPLAY: 1,400%+ gains designed to trigger withdrawal attempt
   and subsequent fee extortion

4. FEE EXTORTION MODEL: Rather than encouraging additional investment, the
   platform pivoted to demanding $900 "release fee" - a different approach
   than gradual investment increases typical in pig butchering

5. IMMEDIATE RETALIATION: Account lockout upon complaint shows:
   - No interest in maintaining relationship
   - Punitive response to resistance
   - Focus on new victims rather than cultivating existing ones

6. QUICK EXIT: Platform shutdown suggests:
   - Operation across many victims simultaneously
   - Exit when extortion attempts fail
   - Time-boxed campaign approach

Sophistication Level: Medium-High
- Professional mobile application
- Multi-platform web interface
- Complex trading simulation
- Multiple asset class support
- Coordinated exit strategy

Victim Impact:
- Limited to $100 loss (avoided $900 additional)
- Victim showed good judgment by complaining and not paying fee
- Psychological impact of scam recognition

Distinguishing Features:
- This case differs from classic long-term relationship pig butchering
- More focused on volume (many victims, small amounts)
- Quick turnaround (small deposit → fake profits → fee extortion → exit)
- Mobile-first approach unusual in pig butchering landscape

Recovery Prospects: None - platform shutdown, funds unrecoverable
