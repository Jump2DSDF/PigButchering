CONCLUSION:
-----------
Case 63 represents a classic pig butchering scam with all traditional elements. Ashley's persona as an experienced crypto investor provided immediate credibility and positioned her as a mentor/guide rather than a romantic interest. The use of Instagram allowed for rich media trust-building (profile pictures, lifestyle posts, etc.). The Ceypro investments platform served as the "slaughterhouse" where the victim was progressively "fattened" through fake profit displays. The $100,000 total loss indicates multiple deposits over an extended period, demonstrating effective psychological manipulation and trust exploitation. The withdrawal barrier tactic (requiring additional deposits to access funds) is a classic final extraction attempt. This case exemplifies why pig butchering scams are so devastating: they combine relationship exploitation, technical sophistication, and psychological manipulation to extract substantial sums from victims over time.
