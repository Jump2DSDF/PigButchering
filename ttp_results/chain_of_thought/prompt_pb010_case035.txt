You are a digital forensics expert specializing in cryptocurrency fraud analysis. Your task is to extract structured TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) information from a Pig Butchering scam complaint narrative.

## Task
Analyze the following victim complaint and extract fraud intelligence using a systematic Chain of Thought approach.

## Input
**Case ID:** 35
**Primary Subject:** Amundi Ltd
**Scam Type:** Pig Butchering Scam

Fraudulent Trading Platform
**Website:** https://www.amundi-ltd.info/
**Complaint Narrative:**
A California consumer was approached online by “Amundi TM” who claimed to be a broker representing an investment firm. The alleged broker encouraged the consumer to access to a trading platform at amundi-ltd.com and then offered “margin loans” to facilitate larger trades. After the larger trades appeared to yield profit, the broker demanded the victim repay the margin loan by wiring funds from their bank, rather than from the profits in the account.

The consumer did not pay and now has been unable to recover their investment. The site is not operational.

## Chain of Thought Analysis

Please follow these steps explicitly and document your reasoning for each:

### Step 1: Initial Contact Analysis (접근 및 유인)
Think through:
- How did the victim first encounter the scammer?
- What platform was used for initial contact?
- Was there a migration to another communication platform?
- What type of lure was used (romance, investment opportunity, etc.)?

### Step 2: Persona & Psychology Analysis (사칭 및 심리)
Think through:
- What identity did the scammer claim?
- What wealth or success indicators were shown?
- What type of relationship was established?
- What psychological manipulation tactics are evident?
- How long was the trust-building phase?

### Step 3: Fraud Mechanism Analysis (사기 수법)
Think through:
- What type of fraudulent platform was used?
- What was the platform name and URL?
- Were fake profits shown to the victim?
- What tactics were used to block withdrawals?

### Step 4: Financial Intelligence Extraction (추적단서)
Think through:
- What cryptocurrencies were involved?
- Are any wallet addresses mentioned?
- Are any transaction hashes mentioned?
- What was the estimated total loss?
- What payment methods were used?

### Step 5: Temporal Analysis (시간적 지표)
Think through:
- How long did the scam last?
- Is the fraudulent platform still operational?

### Step 6: Confidence Assessment
Think through:
- What information was clearly stated vs. inferred?
- What important information is missing?
- Overall confidence in this extraction?

## Output Format
After your Chain of Thought analysis, provide the structured output in the following JSON format:

## Important Guidelines
1. Only extract information explicitly stated or strongly implied in the narrative
2. Use "unknown" or null for information not available
3. Be conservative with confidence scores
4. Document all reasoning in the chain_of_thought section
5. For arrays, include all relevant items found
6. Normalize wallet addresses and URLs as found in the text
