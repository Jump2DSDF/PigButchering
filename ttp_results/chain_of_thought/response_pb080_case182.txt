CHAIN OF THOUGHT ANALYSIS - PIG BUTCHERING SCAM CASE
Case ID: pb_case_id 80 (Original Case ID: 182)
Subject: prolongers.vip

================================================================================
STEP 1: INITIAL CONTACT & TRUST BUILDING
================================================================================

Contact Method:
- TikTok social media platform
- Scammer "Ananya" contacted victim through TikTok
- Social media direct message or comment likely
- Modern social media platform as entry point (newer trend)
- TikTok provides access to younger demographics

Persona Establishment:
- Scammer used name: "Ananya"
- Female persona (typical in pig butchering)
- Name suggests Indian or South Asian origin
- Cultural diversity adds interest and sophistication
- TikTok presence suggests younger, tech-savvy persona

TikTok as Entry Point:
- Increasingly common in newer pig butchering operations
- Platform popular with younger users
- Direct messaging feature enables private contact
- Content can establish persona credibility
- Comments on videos can initiate contact
- Profile can display lifestyle and success

Initial Trust Building Tactics:
- Contact through familiar social media platform
- Ananya's TikTok profile likely showed lifestyle content
- May have displayed wealth, travel, success
- Social media presence creates legitimacy
- Platform familiarity reduces victim suspicion

Investment Pitch - Immediate and Direct:
- "Ananya promised a 20% return within a short period of time"
- Very direct investment pitch (unusual for typical pig butchering)
- Specific return rate: 20%
- Short time frame promised
- Get-rich-quick appeal
- Less emotional relationship building than typical cases

Promise Analysis:
- 20% return is unrealistic for legitimate investments
- "Short period of time" creates urgency
- Specific percentage adds false credibility
- High return low risk promise (classic scam indicator)
- No mention of risk or market volatility

Relationship Development:
- Appears to be primarily financial/business focused
- Less emphasis on romance or friendship
- More direct approach to investment
- Shorter grooming period implied
- Trust built through promised returns rather than emotional connection

Communication Channel:
- Initial contact: TikTok
- Later communication: WhatsApp (mentioned for support/contact)
- Platform migration for ongoing communication
- WhatsApp common for scammer communication (harder to trace)

Investment Amount Negotiation:
- "Convinced the victim to invest $3,000"
- Specific amount: $3,000
- Moderate investment (not too large to scare victim, not too small to be worthwhile)
- Victim may have negotiated or this was suggested amount
- $3,000 accessible to many victims but still significant loss

================================================================================
STEP 2: PLATFORM INTRODUCTION & ONBOARDING
================================================================================

Cryptocurrency Wallet Introduction:
- Victim instructed to use crypto.com
- Victim also instructed to use onChain wallet
- Two-wallet system: exchange and personal wallet
- crypto.com is legitimate cryptocurrency exchange
- onChain wallet for direct blockchain interaction

Crypto.com Usage:
- Legitimate cryptocurrency exchange/platform
- Used to purchase cryptocurrency
- Victim likely bought crypto with $3,000
- Converted fiat currency to cryptocurrency
- Platform provides user-friendly interface for crypto purchases

OnChain Wallet:
- Self-custody wallet for cryptocurrency
- Gives user control of private keys
- Victim transferred crypto from crypto.com to onChain wallet
- Wallet needed to connect to fraudulent exchange
- "Connect the onChain wallet to the prolongers.vip cryptocurrency exchange"

Platform Details:
- Domain: prolongers.vip
- Full URL: http://www.prolongers.vip/
- Platform type: Fraudulent cryptocurrency exchange
- Current status: No longer operational
- .vip TLD (common in scam operations)

Platform Name Analysis:
- "prolongers" - suggests extending or prolonging something
- Could imply prolonging wealth, extending profits
- Unusual name for crypto exchange
- Not recognizable brand or standard exchange name
- Domain name not professionally branded

Wallet Connection Process:
- Victim connected onChain wallet to prolongers.vip
- "Connect" likely means linking wallet address to platform account
- Platform given visibility into wallet or withdrawal permissions
- Connection allows platform to show wallet balance
- May have involved sharing private keys (extremely dangerous)

Account Balance Monitoring:
- Victim used prolongers.vip "to monitor the account balance"
- Platform displayed connected wallet balance
- Balance tracking feature to maintain victim engagement
- Regular checking keeps victim invested in outcome
- Platform showed funds present in account

Onboarding Purpose:
- Two-step process created legitimacy:
  1. Purchase crypto on legitimate platform (crypto.com)
  2. Transfer to personal wallet (onChain)
  3. Connect wallet to trading platform (prolongers.vip)
- Separation of legitimate and fraudulent platforms obscures scam
- Use of real exchange (crypto.com) adds credibility
- Personal wallet gives victim false sense of control

Platform Legitimacy Indicators (Fake):
- Ability to connect wallet
- Balance monitoring dashboard
- Professional-looking interface (implied)
- Account management features
- Withdrawal functionality (claimed)

Technical Infrastructure:
- Web-based platform (http://www.prolongers.vip/)
- Note: HTTP not HTTPS (security red flag)
- .vip domain extension
- Wallet connection capability
- Balance display integration

================================================================================
STEP 3: INVESTMENT & PROFIT DEMONSTRATION
================================================================================

Initial Investment:
- Total investment: $3,000 USD
- Converted to cryptocurrency via crypto.com
- Specific cryptocurrency type not mentioned (likely Bitcoin or Ethereum)
- Transferred from crypto.com to onChain wallet
- Connected to prolongers.vip for "trading"

Fund Visibility Period:
- "The funds appeared to be in the account for a few days"
- Short duration: only a few days
- Victim could see balance on prolongers.vip

- Brief period before withdrawal attempt

Balance Display:
- Platform displayed connected wallet balance
- Victim regularly monitored on prolongers.vip
- May have shown account value in USD or crypto

No Extended Profit Demonstration:
- Unlike typical pig butchering, no mention of:
  * Large artificial profits

Ananya's Role During Investment:
- Provided instructions for crypto purchase and transfer

Psychological Manipulation:
- Promised 20% return maintained hope

Investment Timeline:
