TTP ANALYSIS - CHAIN OF THOUGHT
Case ID: pb_028 (Original Case ID: 74)
Platform: capnovas.com
Analysis Date: 2025-12-17

================================================================================
STEP 1: INITIAL CONTACT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

How did the victim first encounter the scammer?
- The victim was reached out to by an individual on Instagram
- This was an unsolicited contact (cold approach)
- The scammer initiated the conversation

What platform was used for initial contact?
- Instagram was the initial contact platform
- This is a social media platform commonly used for pig butchering scams

Was there a migration to another communication platform?
- The narrative does not explicitly mention migration to another platform
- Communication likely remained on Instagram direct messaging
- No mention of WhatsApp, Telegram, or other messaging apps

What type of lure was used?
- PRIMARY LURE: Investment opportunity
- The scammer showed their own account statements from capnovas.com
- Claimed to have earned "large profits" trading on the platform
- Promised the victim could achieve the same results by copying their method
- This is classic social proof technique - "I'm making money, you can too"

ASSESSMENT: Clear investment opportunity lure with social proof via displayed account statements. Instagram is increasingly common for initial contact in pig butchering operations targeting younger demographics.

================================================================================
STEP 2: PERSONA & PSYCHOLOGY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

What identity did the scammer claim?
- DUAL PERSONA OPERATION:
  1. Initial contact: Successful crypto trader/mentor
  2. Secondary contact: "Trading Account Manager" from capnovas.com platform
- This two-actor approach is sophisticated - creates appearance of legitimate platform with support staff
- Could be two different scammers working together OR single scammer playing multiple roles

What wealth or success indicators were shown?
- Account statements showing large profits from trading
- Claimed expertise in crypto trading
- Positioned as someone with insider knowledge of profitable trading methods
- Authority position as official "Trading Account Manager"

What type of relationship was established?
- Initial: Mentor/investment advisor relationship
- Transition to: Company representative (Trading Account Manager)
- NOT romantic - this is purely financial/business relationship
- Educational framing: "I'll teach you my method"

What psychological manipulation tactics are evident?
1. SOCIAL PROOF: Showing their own successful account statements
2. AUTHORITY: Positioning as Trading Account Manager with platform access
3. FEAR OF MISSING OUT (FOMO): "I'm making large profits, you can too"
4. TRUST BUILDING: Step-by-step guidance on opening account and making test trade
5. URGENCY: Immediate demand for more money after test trade success
6. SUNK COST EXPLOITATION: Once victim has funds in platform and can't withdraw
7. RECIPROCITY: Scammer is "helping" victim learn to trade

How long was the trust-building phase?
- Appears to be relatively SHORT timeline
- Quick progression from initial contact to account opening to test trade
- No indication of weeks/months of relationship building
- This is a "fast burn" approach vs traditional longer-term pig butchering
- Estimate: Days to 1-2 weeks maximum

ASSESSMENT: Sophisticated multi-persona operation with rapid trust-building via social proof. The test trade is the key psychological hook - makes victim believe platform is legitimate and profitable before extraction phase.

================================================================================
STEP 3: FRAUD MECHANISM ANALYSIS
================================================================================

What type of fraudulent platform was used?
- FAKE TRADING PLATFORM
- Presents as crypto asset trading platform
- Website: capnovas.com
- No indication this is a real exchange or legitimate platform

What was the platform name and URL?
- Platform name: capnovas.com (no branding beyond domain)
- URL: capnovas.com
- Domain now defunct (website no longer operational)

Were fake profits shown to the victim?
- YES - CRITICAL TECHNIQUE
- The "test trade" showed the victim making "more than $1,000" profit
- This fake profit display is the key psychological manipulation
- Creates belief that platform is legitimate and profitable
- Encourages victim to deposit more funds
- Classic pig butchering "fattening" phase

What tactics were used to block withdrawals?
- SIMPLE DENIAL OF ACCESS
- Victim "is unable to withdraw any of their funds from the platform"
- No mention of tax demands, verification fees, or other pretexts
- Platform simply prevents withdrawal functionality
- Eventually executed EXIT SCAM (site shut down)

Additional fraud mechanism observations:
- Test trade is sophisticated psychological technique
- Small initial "profit" shown to victim to establish trust
- Immediate demand for more money after test trade success
- This creates urgency and exploits the excitement of perceived profit
- Platform had account management features (viewing balances, making trades)
- Sufficient functionality to appear legitimate during deception phase

ASSESSMENT: Classic fake trading platform with sophisticated test trade hook. The immediate demand for more money after test trade reveals the rushed timeline. Platform has since executed exit scam.

================================================================================
STEP 4: FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE EXTRACTION
================================================================================

What cryptocurrencies were involved?
- Narrative states "crypto assets" generically
- NO SPECIFIC CRYPTOCURRENCY NAMED
- Could be Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, or others
- This is a significant intelligence gap

Are any wallet addresses mentioned?
- NO wallet addresses provided in narrative
- Victim transferred crypto assets "into the account" on platform
- Likely provided a deposit address by platform, but not recorded in complaint

Are any transaction hashes mentioned?
- NO transaction hashes mentioned
- No blockchain tracking information available

What was the estimated total loss?
- NOT QUANTIFIED in the narrative
- We know victim:
  1. Deposited unspecified amount initially
  2. Supposedly made $1,000+ in test trade (fake)
  3. Cannot withdraw any funds
- Actual loss amount: UNKNOWN
- Loss includes: Initial deposit + any additional amounts sent

What payment methods were used?
- Victim transferred crypto assets to the platform
- Method of acquisition not specified (could be:
  - Purchase from legitimate exchange (Coinbase, Kraken, etc.)
  - Peer-to-peer transfer
  - Bitcoin ATM
  - Other source)
- Transfer method: Direct crypto transfer to platform account

ASSESSMENT: Significant gaps in financial intelligence. Without cryptocurrency type, wallet addresses, or transaction hashes, blockchain tracing is not possible. The lack of specific loss amount is common in initial complaints. This limits investigative and recovery options.

================================================================================
STEP 5: TEMPORAL ANALYSIS
================================================================================

How long did the scam last?
- Timeline appears COMPRESSED/RAPID
- Sequence: Instagram contact → Account statements shown → Introduction to Manager → Account opening → Crypto transfer → Test trade → Demand for more money → Refusal → Withdrawal blocked
- No indication of extended trust-building period
- Estimate: Several days to 2 weeks maximum
- This is faster than typical pig butchering which can last months

Is the fraudulent platform still operational?
- PLATFORM STATUS: DEFUNCT
- "The website is no longer operational"
- This is EXIT SCAM behavior
- Platform likely shut down after extracting funds from multiple victims
- Common pattern: Scammers operate for weeks/months, then disappear

Temporal observations:
- Quick progression suggests organized operation with established playbook
- Test trade technique indicates prior successful use of this method
- Platform shutdown indicates:
  1. Operation reached target extraction amount, OR
  2. Too much victim attention/complaints triggered shutdown, OR
  3. Platform rotation (common tactic - shut down one, open another)

ASSESSMENT: Fast-burn operation (days to weeks) with exit scam conclusion. Platform shutdown eliminates victim recovery options and makes scammer identification more difficult.
