The first California resident indicated they were messaged on Facebook by someone claiming to be a crypto investor. The Facebook investor asked to move the conversations over to WhatsApp, and then presented an investment opportunity involving bitcoin trades, promising high returns. All told the victim invested more than$400,000 and stated that they can no longer access their cryptocurrency. The victim reports the domain name changed several times, and reports encountering the following domains: bittisport.com, nvbit.cc, frbit.cc, cbmww.com. The second California resident reports being approached by "Yinan" on Facebook. Yinan told the resident she had a successful business and was planning to retire early. When the resident inquired about this, Yinan claimed to have an uncle who managed a team of analysts that could determine which crypto asset to invest. Yinan showed business statements to the resident to prove she had made solid returns. Yinan then directed the resident to open an account on the crypto asset trading platform, CBMWW, operating at www.cbmww.com. The victim initially invested and was able to withdraw their first profit of $1,000. After that Yinan enticed the resident to deposit more funds, claiming she would regularly provide information about upcoming markets to trade in along. At one point, the resident believed that their account had grown to more than $1 million. But when they tried to withdraw funds, the platform's customer support demanded the resident pay the "Cryptocurrency Regulatory Authority" a $260,000 tax. Yinan offered to help pay half of the tax, but the victim realized she was only trying to gain access to their crypto asset wallet. All told, the resident lost over $179,000. The websites are no longer operational. The resident reported sending cryptocurrency to the following wallet addresses: 0xb1ee662001a0247270b282e03cfc0c86642babec, 0xa5fe0f74911715f5d6290d39da823c8e15986554",

After a month of trading, Kevin introduced another investment opportunity that he wanted them to be a part of. Kevin told the resident that he had an aunt who used to work at NASDAQ and worked with a group of experts in bitcoin options trading. Kevin's aunt purportedly gave him an $8 million quota in preparation for an upcoming investment opportunity that would take place in a month. The resident liquidated their brokerage account to participate in the investment. A few weeks later, Kevin told the resident he was short $500,000 in preparation for the $8 million trading signal and convinced the resident to liquidate their retirement accounts to make up the difference. After the execution of the $8 million trade signal, Kevin claimed the trade resulted in a $1.6 million loss but introduced another $12 million investment opportunity and convinced the resident to take out personal loans in order to participate. However, days after the execution of the purported investment the platform was shut down. All told, the investor reported losing over $3.8 million to Zipmexpro. The website is no longer operational.

At first, the victim believed they were making profits and was able to withdraw money from their account. This encouraged the victim to send even more money to Unktlife.com. But when the victim tried to withdraw money to buy a house, the website demanded they pay a "tax credit" to access their funds. The victim paid the fees but now Unktlife.com no longer responds to them and they haven't been able to recover any more of their money. All told, the victim lost more than $550,000.

But when the victim tried to withdraw funds, Abnas Global demanded that they pay $240,000 in "taxes" or have their assets confiscated. The victim reached out to Tina, who offered to pay some of the supposed tax, if the victim paid $100,000 to the platform. Then, Abnas Global demanded a fine of $160,000. Again, Tina convinced the victim to pay the fine by offering to pay the remaining balance after the victim paid $140,000 of the fine. Ultimately, the victim sent the platform more than $1,200,000, and has not retrieved any funds. None of the sites are operational now.",
