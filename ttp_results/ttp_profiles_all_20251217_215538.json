Used trust building, authority/expertise claims, FOMO, social proof, and sunk cost exploitation. Victim 2 experienced artificial requirements (minimum trades), moving goalposts (5 trades → 5 more), and percentage-based fee extraction (10% of fake $100K+ balance).",
      "step3_fraud_mechanism": "Fake crypto trading platform operating on up-business.top and up-business.business (dual domains). Both victims shown fake substantial profits. Withdrawal blocking via: (V1) complete block, (V2) escalating barriers: minimum trades → more trades → 10% upfront fee. Platform now defunct - classic exit scam.",

Medium confidence: crypto type (inferred from address), scam duration, coordinated operation, psychological tactics. Low/Missing: Victim 2 wallet/amounts, transaction hashes, exact crypto types, specific dates, payment methods, technical infrastructure. Overall: 0.7 - Well-documented TTPs and one blockchain indicator, but incomplete financial tracking data."
