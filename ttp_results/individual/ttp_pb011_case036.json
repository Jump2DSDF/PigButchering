Scammer claimed to contribute $40,000 for VIP membership (likely false or accomplice transaction). Tax amount and whether final $20,000 withdrawal fee was paid are unspecified. Total loss unknown but minimum $20,400 plus initial investment and tax. Platform now defunct. Sophisticated psychological manipulation using reciprocity tactic where scammer offers to help pay fees."
