    "step1_initial_contact": "Victim approached online by scammer who established 'online friend' relationship before platform introduction. Classic friendship-based lure transitioning to investment opportunity. Initial platform unspecified, likely migrated to messaging app for sustained communication.",
    "step2_persona_psychology": "Scammer posed as online friend with investment knowledge. Used trust building, graduated commitment (small start), fake profit displays ($140K+), sunk cost exploitation through two-tier fees, and legitimization through professional fee terminology. Extended relationship building phase evident from 'over time' deposits.",
    "step3_fraud_mechanism": "Fake crypto trading platform 'OSL' at oslvsap.vip (likely impersonating legitimate OSL exchange). Displayed fake profits ($140K+), encouraged graduated deposits over time. Two-stage withdrawal blocking: 20% management fee ($25K paid), then verification fee ($21K demanded). Platform went defunct after extraction.",
    "step4_financial_intelligence": "Total loss $90,000+ confirmed. Breakdown: multiple deposits over time, $25K management fee paid, $21K verification fee demanded. Displayed fake account value of $140K+. No wallet addresses or transaction hashes provided. Cryptocurrency type unspecified (generic 'crypto assets').",
    "step5_temporal_analysis": "Extended duration (estimated 1-3 months) indicated by 'over time' deposits and relationship building. Multi-phase timeline: contact → friendship → platform introduction → graduated investments → fake profit observation → withdrawal blocking → fee extraction → exit scam. Platform confirmed defunct.",
    "step6_confidence_assessment": "High confidence (0.9+) on platform details, fees, total loss, withdrawal tactics. Medium confidence (0.6-0.8) on timeline estimates and psychological tactics (inferred). Low confidence on missing items: initial platform, messaging app, crypto types, wallet addresses, exact dates. Overall: 0.80. Strong pattern analysis but limited forensic tracking data."
