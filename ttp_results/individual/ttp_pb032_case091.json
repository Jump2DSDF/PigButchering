    "notes": "HIGH PRIORITY case due to 5 wallet addresses providing strong blockchain tracking opportunity. Two victims with similar attack patterns involving dimensionvip.com. First victim (Ryan contact) experienced deposit-to-withdraw trap. Second victim was recruited via WhatsApp investment club 'Dimensional Fund Advisors' (impersonating legitimate investment firm). Both victims shown fake profits then blocked from withdrawal via fee/deposit demands. Platform now defunct (exit scam). Second victim confirmed minimum $5,000 loss. All 5 Ethereum wallet addresses (0x...) extracted for blockchain analysis. Strong social proof tactic via investment club group. Multiple withdrawal blocking methods indicate sophisticated operation."
