    "notes": "HIGH-VALUE CASE: $370,000+ total loss representing most of victim's life savings. California resident. Sophisticated multi-stage approach: (1) Initial WhatsApp contact claiming professional services interest, (2) Friendship cultivation over months, (3) Investment education and mentorship, (4) Platform introduction showing substantial fake returns, (5) Withdrawal block via $200K 'VAT tax' demand with 7-day deadline, (6) Secondary extraction: $120K wire transfer for 'friend's' withdrawal fee - solidarity manipulation tactic. Notable tactics: Professional services initial angle (vs typical romance), educational approach building authority and reciprocity, scammer claimed same withdrawal issue to validate fake tax scenario and extract additional $120K via wire transfer. Multi-channel extraction (crypto + traditional wire). Platform Taurus Chain (Tauruschain.net) now defunct. Victim showed some caution by not paying $200K tax but had already lost $370K. Attempted total extraction: $570K+ ($250K platform deposits + $120K wire paid + $200K tax demanded). Loss breakdown estimated: ~$250K in crypto to platform, $120K wire to 'friend'. Demonstrates sophisticated targeting of high-value professional victims with patient, months-long cultivation period."
