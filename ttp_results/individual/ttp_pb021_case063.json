    "notes": "This case follows classic Pig Butchering withdrawal blocking pattern: victim deposits $91,000+, platform shows fake balance of $289,000, then demands $49,000 in 'taxes' to withdraw. The 'electric gold' product name is designed to sound innovative and valuable. Platform is now defunct. High confidence in fraud mechanism details, moderate confidence in initial contact and relationship building aspects due to limited narrative detail."
