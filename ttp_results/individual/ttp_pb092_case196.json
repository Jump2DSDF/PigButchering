The mobile app distribution and immediate retaliation to complaints suggests an operation focused on quick turnover rather than long-term victim cultivation. The extreme profit display (1,400%+) appears designed to trigger rapid withdrawal attempts, enabling the fee extortion phase. Victim showed excellent judgment by refusing to pay the $900 fee, limiting losses to the initial $100 deposit.",
