Platform Cypo (eth-cryp.com) showed fake profits growing from $34,000 to $150,000+. Sophisticated withdrawal blocking: tax demand, partial withdrawal allowed ($2,000) to maintain legitimacy, then complete fund lockage. Platform now defunct - exit scam completed. Estimated loss $63,000. Critical gaps: no blockchain tracking data (wallet addresses/hashes), preventing fund tracing. Californian victim. Video call usage more sophisticated than text-only scams, creates stronger legitimacy and emotional connection."
