    "overview": "A California resident fell victim to a sophisticated pig butchering scam involving the fraudulent cryptocurrency trading platform Hikkod.com. The victim was initially contacted via a dating app, then moved to WhatsApp where a relationship was developed. The scammer convinced the victim to invest $15,000 in crypto trading, fabricated account growth to $570,000+, allowed a small $1,000 withdrawal to build trust, then blocked further withdrawals with a $20,000 'tax payment' demand. The website subsequently shut down.",
