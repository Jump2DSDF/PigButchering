    "notes": "Classic investment-type pig butchering scam. Victim contacted via WhatsApp by 'Lin' who positioned as investment mentor/advisor. Lin directed victim to fake crypto trading platform CBOTBIT (cbotbit.com) and provided trading instructions. Platform showed fake substantial account growth to encourage continued deposits. When victim attempted withdrawal after depositing $40k+, platform completely blocked withdrawal function. Platform now defunct (no longer operational). Critical intelligence gaps: no wallet addresses, transaction hashes, or specific cryptocurrency types prevent blockchain tracking. No specific timeline provided. Scammer name 'Lin' consistent with Asian-origin pig butchering operations. Platform URL cbotbit.com available for OSINT/historical analysis. Victim located in California. Pattern matches standard pig butchering playbook: trust building → platform introduction → fake profits → withdrawal blocking → exit scam. Loss amount ($40k+) indicates high-value victim and likely multiple escalating deposits. Recommend follow-up: domain OSINT on cbotbit.com, request victim's exchange transaction records, WhatsApp communication logs, and any wallet addresses used for transfers."
