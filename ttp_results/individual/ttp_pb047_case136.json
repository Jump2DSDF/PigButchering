    "notes": "Sophisticated Pig Butchering scam featuring two-person operation (Nathan + Amy) impersonating legitimate dYdX Exchange. Started with social media contact, migrated to WhatsApp group for social proof. Nathan positioned as financial consultant offering free advice (reciprocity), then charged $8,000 in commissions for trading signals. Victim deposited funds into fake DYDX Wallet (dydxgroup.com) and saw fake profits. Withdrawal blocked by $3,000 commission demand. Total loss $22,000. Platform now defunct. Notable for professional business framing rather than romance/friendship, brand impersonation strategy, and tiered revenue extraction (signals + deposits + withdrawal fees). Missing blockchain tracking data limits investigation capability."
