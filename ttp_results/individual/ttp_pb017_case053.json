    "notes": "Fast-moving investment fraud variant of Pig Butchering scam. Distinguished by lack of romance element and compressed timeline (3-day profit promise vs months-long relationship building in classic cases). Sophisticated multi-tier extraction with three separate fee demands demonstrates organized operation. The 'false rescue' where original scammer offered to help for $1,500 is particularly notable - this integrates recovery scam tactics into the primary fraud. Facebook testimonials showing luxury purchases (cars, houses) provide powerful social proof. Victim showed financial awareness by refusing final $1,500 demand but had already paid 15% fee ($9,000). Platform now defunct (typical exit scam). California resident victim. Significant intelligence gaps in financial tracking data severely limit blockchain investigation potential."
