  "summary": "A California resident lost $240,000+ in a sophisticated pig butchering scam that began with a romantic relationship on an online dating app. The scammer introduced the victim to 'short-term crypto asset trading' and directed them to open an account on stdubrye.top. At the scammer's direction, the victim made progressive deposits totaling over $240,000. When the victim attempted to withdraw funds, the platform demanded a $275,000 payment. The victim wisely refused, and the scammer immediately stopped responding. The platform is no longer operational, and the victim has been unable to recover any funds.",

Case reported to authorities with substantial evidence of pig butchering scam tactics.",
  "analyst_notes": "This case exemplifies a classic romance-based pig butchering scam with several notable characteristics: (1) Dating app as initial attack vector establishing romantic relationship, (2) Direct control pattern - victim acted 'at the direction of the individual' throughout, (3) Significant financial loss of $240,000+, (4) Excessive withdrawal fee demand ($275,000) exceeding the victim's total investment, (5) Victim's critical smart decision to refuse the $275,000 payment prevented additional loss, (6) Immediate scammer ghosting when extraction failed confirmed fraudulent nature of relationship, (7) Coordinated platform shutdown (stdubrye.top no longer operational), (8) Use of .top TLD consistent with fraud patterns. The victim's refusal to pay the excessive withdrawal fee was crucial in preventing an additional $275,000 loss, demonstrating the importance of recognizing that withdrawal fees exceeding investments are always fraudulent. The immediate cessation of communication after fee refusal starkly revealed the relationship was entirely fabricated for financial exploitation. No wallet addresses documented, limiting blockchain analysis opportunities. This case should be used for public awareness about the dating app + crypto investment scam pattern that exploits both romantic and financial vulnerabilities."
