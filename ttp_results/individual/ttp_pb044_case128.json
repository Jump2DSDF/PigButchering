Critical gap: No blockchain forensic data (wallet addresses, transaction hashes) severely limits law enforcement asset recovery potential. Platform impersonated legitimate Zipmex exchange using 'pro' suffix. Scammer used sophisticated multi-phase approach with proof-of-legitimacy withdrawal, insider access narratives (NASDAQ aunt), and manufactured crisis. Victim had high financial sophistication but was successfully manipulated through mentorship framing and escalating commitment tactics. Platform currently offline. Recovery unlikely without additional technical intelligence."
