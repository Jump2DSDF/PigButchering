DUAL-VECTOR ATTACK: (1) Romance-based via Tinder ($51K+ loss), (2) Professional cold-call 'broker' approach ($11K loss). Combined loss: $62,000+ from two California victims. Sophisticated 'short-term capital gains tax' withdrawal blocking (V1). Platform exit scam (defunct). Professional operation with multi-channel victim acquisition. Geographic concentration in California suggests possible targeting. Loss amount variance reflects different victim profiles/relationship depths. Critical need for blockchain data. High priority for brand impersonation report to legitimate Tickmill and domain investigation.",
