    "notes": "Sophisticated professional broker impersonation variant using brand hijacking (legitimate Amundi company). Unique TTP: margin loan trap - offering institutional-style margin lending, then demanding external repayment despite fake profits displayed. Victim demonstrated good judgment by refusing illogical wire transfer demand. Fast-burn variant (3-6 weeks) vs typical romance-based scams (months). No explicit cryptocurrency mention - may be traditional securities fraud angle. Platform defunct. Strong operational TTP profile but weak financial tracking data. Case highlights evolution of pig butchering from romance-based to professional investment scams targeting different demographics."
