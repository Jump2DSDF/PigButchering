    "notes": "This case demonstrates a sophisticated pig butchering operation with multiple distinct tactical approaches: (1) RAPID EXTRACTION (Victim 1/Moses): WhatsApp contact, mentorship lure, quick onboarding, initial success followed by sudden $75k loss in minutes via claimed trading volatility - fast-exit model; (2) EXTENDED PIG BUTCHERING (Victim 2/Vivian): LinkedIn professional approach, extended relationship over time with multiple deposits, $1.66M fake profits displayed, CRITICAL $55k successful withdrawal to prove legitimacy, then 45% tax barrier ($747k demand) with scammer offering $350k contribution as reciprocity pressure, ending in account lock/closure. The operation shows high sophistication: multi-platform targeting (WhatsApp + LinkedIn), gender-diverse personas suggesting organized group, victim-tailored approaches (fast vs. slow con), and proof-of-concept withdrawal capability. The $55k successful withdrawal is a key tactical element that distinguishes this from simpler scams - it overcomes withdrawal skepticism and makes subsequent large tax demands seem plausible. Both California residents unable to recover funds. Estimated total losses: $75k confirmed (Victim 1) + $100k-$500k estimated (Victim 2 deposits) = $175k-$575k combined. Platform operated at frtcnet.live and frtc.net. Critical gap: no blockchain tracking data (addresses/hashes) limits financial investigation capability."
