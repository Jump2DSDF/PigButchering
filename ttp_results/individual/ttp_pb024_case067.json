    "notes": "Task Scam variant of Pig Butchering - victim lured with crypto mining job offer instead of romance/investment. Scammer 'Diana' posed as recruiter for 'RIOT Blockchain platform' (impersonating legitimate Riot Platforms, Inc.). Sophisticated progression: job offer → training → deposit demand → daily task work with fake rewards → escalating deposits → withdrawal blocked by 'credibility rating' system. Victim deposited nearly $81,000 in increasing amounts, eventually borrowing money to continue. Novel withdrawal blocking mechanism: platform required deposits to increase 'credibility rating' to enable withdrawals (gamification of fraud). Critical intelligence gaps: no platform URL, wallet addresses, or transaction hashes prevent blockchain tracking. Victim located in California. This represents an emerging variant targeting job seekers rather than romance/investment victims, exploiting employment psychology and brand impersonation of legitimate public company."
