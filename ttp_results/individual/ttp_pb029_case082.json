    "notes": "Minimal intelligence case with classic fake exchange exit scam pattern. Victim established account and deposited unspecified amount of cryptocurrency. When attempting withdrawal, platform representatives demanded various fees and taxes - standard withdrawal blocking tactic. Complete loss of funds occurred. Platform now defunct, indicating coordinated exit scam. Narrative extremely sparse with no initial contact method, no financial details, no blockchain tracking data, and no timeline information. This significantly limits investigative and pattern analysis capabilities. The fee/tax demand combination is a hallmark of Pig Butchering exit scams. Case demonstrates typical fraudulent exchange operations: appear legitimate until withdrawal attempt, then demand escalating fees to release funds that never materialize."
