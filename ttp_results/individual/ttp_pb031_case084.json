    "notes": "MODERATE INVESTIGATIVE VALUE. Key observations: (1) TikTok as initial contact platform is noteworthy and less common than traditional dating apps or WhatsApp - worth monitoring for emerging trend; (2) Classic investment opportunity lure with cryptocurrency focus; (3) Standard withdrawal blocking via fee demand; (4) Platform is defunct (exit scam completed); (5) CRITICAL LIMITATION: No financial tracking data (amounts, addresses, transactions) severely limits blockchain investigation potential; (6) Brief narrative suggests preliminary complaint - may have supplemental documentation elsewhere; (7) Victim confirmed total loss of invested funds but amount not specified; (8) Fake profits are implied by withdrawal attempt but not explicitly confirmed in narrative; (9) No communication platform migration mentioned, unusual for pig butchering operations; (10) Recommend follow-up to obtain: specific loss amount, cryptocurrency types, wallet addresses, transaction hashes, timeline, and scammer contact details for enhanced investigative value."
