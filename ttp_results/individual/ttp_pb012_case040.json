    "notes": "Classic pig butchering case with dating app origin. Notable TTP: coordinated operation where platform itself sent SMS to victim, adding legitimacy. Deposit-matching bonus scheme used as aggressive acquisition tactic. Standard progression: dating app → WhatsApp → shared goals discussion → crypto investment introduction → platform recommendation with pressure → deposit → exit scam. Platform name 'bitsorcoinss.com' uses typosquatting technique (double 's'). Strong operational TTP profile but zero financial tracking data (no amounts, addresses, or transaction hashes). Case exemplifies textbook romance-to-investment pig butchering with sophisticated coordination between romance scammer and platform operators. Platform now defunct, preventing evidence recovery."
