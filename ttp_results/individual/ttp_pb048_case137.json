    "notes": "Two-victim case demonstrating multiple attack vectors: (1) social/investment approach and (2) classic romance-to-investment Pig Butchering. Platform MIC Markets (micmarkfx.com) operated as mobile app. Notable tactics: allowed small initial withdrawals to build trust, progressive pressure escalation including bullying into 401(k) withdrawal and personal loans, fake profit demonstrations (25% gains), scammer contributed $1,000 to appear invested. Victim 2 discovered catfishing (fake photos/identity confirmed). Exit scam executed when victims attempted major withdrawals - platform went completely offline. Combined losses $65,000. California residents. Platform now defunct. Classic progression: trust building → small wins → major deposits → withdrawal blocks → fee demands → exit scam."
