Displayed massive fake profits ($2M+ from $358K in weeks) to encourage deposits. Exit attempt via percentage-based fee (~$400K) exceeding actual deposits. Platform defunct after victim unable to pay. Represents emerging trend of technology-themed investment scams vs traditional romance-based approach. California resident victim."
