  "chain_of_thought": {
    "step1_initial_contact": "Two victims contacted separately: Victim 1 via Facebook by 'Raddy' then moved to WhatsApp; Victim 2 directly on WhatsApp by 'Reddy'. Similar scammer names suggest coordinated operation. Classic friendship-to-investment lure pattern with gradual trust building 'over time'.",
    "step2_persona_psychology": "Scammers posed as crypto trading experts with access to AI trading programs promising 'stable returns'. Used trust building, authority/expertise claims, FOMO, social proof, and sunk cost exploitation. Victim 2 experienced artificial requirements (minimum trades), moving goalposts (5 trades → 5 more), and percentage-based fee extraction (10% of fake $100K+ balance).",
    "step3_fraud_mechanism": "Fake crypto trading platform operating on up-business.top and up-business.business (dual domains). Both victims shown fake substantial profits. Withdrawal blocking via: (V1) complete block, (V2) escalating barriers: minimum trades → more trades → 10% upfront fee. Platform now defunct - classic exit scam.",
    "step4_financial_intelligence": "Victim 1 sent crypto to 0xB10ABECA64cf19d37c45045a5851BB528fB21E47 (Ethereum address), losing $55,000+. Victim 2 saw fake balance of $100,000+, actual loss unknown. Only one wallet address recovered. Cryptocurrency type likely Ethereum/ERC-20 tokens based on address format. No transaction hashes provided.",
    "step5_temporal_analysis": "Extended duration indicated by 'over time' for trust building - typical weeks to months. Multiple phases: contact → trust building → investment introduction → trading → withdrawal blocks → extraction attempts. Platform shut down post-extraction. Two concurrent victims suggest coordinated multi-target operation.",
    "step6_confidence_assessment": "High confidence: platform URLs, scammer names, contact platforms, one wallet address, fake profits, AI program claims, platform defunct status. Medium confidence: crypto type (inferred from address), scam duration, coordinated operation, psychological tactics. Low/Missing: Victim 2 wallet/amounts, transaction hashes, exact crypto types, specific dates, payment methods, technical infrastructure. Overall: 0.7 - Well-documented TTPs and one blockchain indicator, but incomplete financial tracking data."
