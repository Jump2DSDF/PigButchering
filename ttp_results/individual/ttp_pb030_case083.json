    "notes": "TSAI Exchange operated as a fake cryptocurrency exchange platform accessed via techstarvoip.com. Victim contacted through WhatsApp and convinced to open account and transfer crypto assets. Platform collected extensive PII (email, address, phone). Victim unable to recover funds; website now defunct (classic exit scam). CRITICAL GAPS: No wallet addresses or transaction hashes provided - severely limits blockchain investigation capability. No loss amount specified. Domain name 'techstarvoip' (VoIP-related) incongruous with crypto exchange branding, suggesting repurposed infrastructure or deliberate obfuscation. Case has medium operational intelligence value (platform identification, attack vector confirmation) but low financial tracking value due to missing blockchain data. Recommend victim follow-up to obtain: wallet addresses from transaction history, transaction hashes, specific crypto types, loss amounts, and any platform screenshots or communications preserved."
