The online acquaintance persuaded the victim to deposit $45,000 into a trading account on MIC Markets.  Over time, the victim believed they had doubled their money trading crypto assets.  At first, the victim was able to withdraw small amounts of money from their trading account.  But, when the victim tried to withdraw their total balance, their withdrawal was blocked.  The site demanded that the victim pay ”taxes” before they could withdraw.  They have since been unable to withdraw anything.

The second victim was introduced to MIC Markets by someone they met on a popular dating app.  After moving the conversation to WhatsApp, the romantic interest asked the victim to join him in investing money to create a strong financial future together.  The romantic interest asked the victim to download a Bitcoin wallet app and the MIC Markets trading app.  The imposter then appeared to add $1,000 to the victim’s account and executed a few trades, quickly making a 25% profit.  Based on this demonstration, the victim transferred 
thousands of dollars to their MIC Markets account, believing they would be able to turn a similar profit.  But then the romantic interest bullied the victim into funding their account with even more money, either from their 401(k) or from personal loans.  The victim subsequently took out a $20,000 loan and transferred it to their MIC Markets account.  

Once the victim’s profit reached $50,000, they tried to withdraw it.  But MIC Markets refused to process the withdrawal and demanded a 20% fee.  The romantic interest promised to pay part of the fee if the victim paid the rest using money from their 401(k).  At some point, the victim discovered that the romantic interest had used someone else’s photos and information to create a fake dating profile.

The DFPI cautions that, traditionally, when interacting with someone you do not know through a social media or messaging platform, one potential indicator that the other party may be scammer could be an aversion on their part to engage in live interactions (e.g. meeting in person, having video calls). However, that alone does not confirm fraudulent activity, as scammers may use various tactics to manipulate their appearance, such as using actors/actresses to engage in live interactions on their behalf. In addition, please note that with ongoing advancements in AI, scammers may become increasingly adept at leveraging generative AI and deepfake technologies to manipulate their appearance and deceive potential victims.","Fraudulent Trading Platform

The victim tried to deposit additional sums twice more, and each time was told the same.  After four withdrawal attempts, the victim was told that the system rejected the withdrawal because too many accounts joined the Fast Track withdrawal service.

The victim complied and sent the money to the Professor.  

After that, the victim tried withdraw their money but was convinced to make one more trade on the site.  This last trade resulted in a loss of the victim’s entire account balance.

Emily also appeared to deposit money into the victim’s account.

Relying on Emily’s advice, the victim made trades on Amgex and their account appeared to grow in value. However, Emily told the victim that her uncle needed $50,000 in order to continue providing advice. The victim stated that they no longer wished to continue trading on Amgex. When attempting to withdraw funds to their usual crypto wallet, the victim learned that customer support flagged the account and prevented withdrawals from taking place. Customer support asserted Emily’s account that made a deposit into the victim’s account was a “high risk” account and that the victim’s account was now suspected of participating in money laundering.

Amgex then demanded that the victim send photos of their ID card, bank transfer records, and a deposit of 10% of the victim’s purported balance on the platform. The victim declined and has not recovered their funds.

Unfamiliar with cryptocurrency, the victim relied on Mollie's guidance. She explained how crypto trading worked and presented herself as knowledgeable and professional. Mollie helped the victim set up accounts on multiple legitimate trading platforms, and AMGEX Trading platform, teaching them how to buy crypto using their bank account. To build trust, Mollie showed how much she had allegedly earned from trading in crypto, which convinced the victim to invest.

Following Mollie's instructions, the victim bought $1,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) and transferred them to the AMGEX platform for trading. After earning $250, Mollie showed the victim how to withdraw from AMGEX and transfer the funds back to a legitimate crypto exchange, which was then sent to their bank account. Encouraged by this initial success, the victim transferred an additional $30,000 worth of crypto to AMGEX for further trading. Mollie even encouraged the victim to invest an additional $100,000, but they refused.

When the victim's account balance reached $241,000, they attempted to withdraw $1,000 in USDT.

Scammers may even attempt to file for registration on these databases, even if they have no intention of being approved, in order to mislead consumers. When looking up a company on a government database, it is important to not only identify whether the name is listed on the database, but also confirm the registration status as determined by the accrediting government agency.","Fraudulent Trading Platform

At first, the victim made a few trades and saw their balance indeed did increase by at least 25%.

Adriana reached out to the victim and asked them to contact her. Thinking this was someone that the victim's friend knew, the victim contacted Adriana, who explained that she made money by investing in crypto assets through a platform that generated 10 times the capital in profits, and that she could cash out every day.  Adriana continued to send text message via Telegram and eventually convinced the victim to send $2,000 via Zelle. Next, Adriana instructed the victim how to register and open an account on www.coinproxyus.com.   Adriana uploaded a screenshot of the $2,000 that was supposedly deposited there and showed the victim their profits were increasing on the platform. Adriana encouraged the victim to cash out $100, the daily limit, which really showed up in his bank account. Adriana said that proved the account was fluid, that the platform worked, and that the victim would be able to get their money back. Adriana told the victim his account was only at the “Basic” level, and that if the victim upgraded to the “Bronze” level they would have access to unlimited withdrawals, just like their friend had done. Still unaware of the hack, the victim contacted their friend on Instagram who confirmed the process and stated that the victim would be so happy with all that money and not worry about anything.  The victim asked their friend to give him a call, but the victim's friend replied that they were busy.  Soon after, the victim's “friend” contacted them on Instagram and said he got a new phone number.  Soon, Adriana contacted the victim and told him to transfer $3,000 onto the platform to qualify for the “Bronze” level. But when they did that, Adriana said they misunderstood and it was supposed to be $5,000.  The victim asked Adriana if they could start taking out some of their profits, but she encouraged the victim to wait until the profits reached $20,000.  The victim decided to try to take some of the daily $100 withdrawals to reduce the victim's balance, but this time they were unsuccessful.  The victim then asked Adriana why they couldn’t withdraw the daily limit, and she told them the pay outs would only disturb the trades, so they had to be patient and wait until they reached their goal of $20,000 to cash out.  The next morning Adriana told the victim their account balance had reached $20,689 and they could now withdraw their funds.  But when the victim tried to do so, they received an email from the platform saying they needed to file a trading certificate and provide personal information.  The victim reached out to Adriana to ask how to get their money back without providing their personal information but she never responded. The victim later found out their friend’s Instagram account had been hacked and that it was a scam. The website is no longer operational.","Hacking

Sundell FX
Sundell-fx.com","Two Californians complained separately about the gold trading platform, Sundell Ltd. (Sundell-fx.com).

The first victim was contacted on LinkedIn by “Amelia” who expressed interest in the victim’s home country of Korea and struck up a casual conversation about life experiences there versus the U.S. The conversations eventually switched to WhatsApp and they continued to talk about many subjects. The victim even had a video call with Amelia. At some point, Amelia told the victim she wanted to be the victim's mentor for financial investments, introducing them to “gold future trading” which they had never heard of. Amelia showed the victim a demo trading platform at Sunderll-fx, and said they could make a profit. Amelia kept asking the victim to transfer more money so they could make more profits. Eventually, the victims’ account showed a profit of $83,000 dollars.  But when the victim attempted to withdraw some funds from the trading platform, their request was denied and the platform asked them to provide an Identification card and bank account for verification process.  The victim called their bank, who advised against this. The victim’s account was eventually deactivated. The victim did some research and found out Sundell-fx was a scam platform and there were other victims who could not withdraw their money. The victim lost $141,000 to this scam.
  
The second victim provided screen shots and copies of emails from Sundell showing how elaborate the scam was. The website claimed that Sundell Ltd was a UK registered online trading platform providing online trading for cryptocurrency, various foreign currencies, and precious metals (gold, silver, etc.). Sundell Ltd also claimed it was registered as a money services business in the US.

This victim describes themselves as an overseas option trader and used the Sundell platform for trading gold options. They were able to make a few withdrawals, which made them feel comfortable, though the withdrawals represented less than 10% of their investment.  The victim attempted to make another withdraw, but this time Sundell froze his account and demanded he pay a “UK personal income tax” on the entire amount invested. Not only that, but the platform said he couldn’t use his profits to pay the tax, but had to contribute new money, and further, they had to do this before the deadline of about a week or they would permanently freeze their account and take away their assets. The victim's account balance at the time was more than $16 million, and the tax they demanded was almost $800,000. The victim was unable to pay the money before the deadline, so their account was frozen and showed a zero balance. The victim lost more than $350,000 on the platform plus their expected profits, and the website is no longer operational.

The Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) issued a Consumer Alert against Sundell-fx, and others, alleging they were part of a cryptocurrency scam ring operating out of Los Angeles and San Francisco. (See the link here: https://dfi.wa.gov/consumer/alerts/alleged-cryptocurrency-scam-ring-operating-out-los-angeles-and-san-francisco).

The victim expressed interest in investing in crypto and but told Victoria they didn't know much. Victoria said she got into investing after her aunt, who works on Wall Street, taught her. Victoria  showed screen shots of her trades and profits and told the victim that she could teach her how to trade. She showed the victim how to purchase crypto assets on an exchange, then sent a link to the trading platform drwap and showed the victim how to register there. Victoria then showed the victim how to transfer the crypto assets she purchased into their trading account on the DRW platform.
 
Victoria had the victim start with a small amount, and the victim was able to move $200 on to the platform, then withdraw it back into their wallet on the crypto asset exchange. The victim began to trust the process and regularly deposited more funds to their DRW trading account. Victoria continued to coach the victim, instructing them to copy their trades and put in the same amount of money they were trading. Then, when the victim's DRW account showed a value of $149,962.59, Victoria told them the trading cycle was done, and it was time to take their profits. But when the victim tried to withdraw approximately $ 100,000 from DRW, they got a message saying their assets were frozen and that they needed to contact customer service. Customer service said that because the victim's profits exceeded 100% of the amount deposited, they had to pay a 35% capital gains tax, or approximately $40,000, and that they could not pay taxes from the DRW account but had to pay directly.

First, they required him to pay a 20% “tax” on his profits. Next, he needed to provide a copy of his government ID card and post a $10,000 (purportedly “refundable”) payment in order to verify his identity, after which they accused him of “insider trading” and said he needed to stake 50% of his $75,000 deposit, which would be returned if he was cleared of all charges.

The second victim from California met a man online who offered to teach the victim how to trade in crypto options. After the victim created a crypto wallet and deposited money in Coinrus.com, the scammer had the victim convert his entire balance and trade only using the USDT stablecoin currency. The scammer manipulated trade results to make it look like the victim was making good profits with each trade. The scammer aggressively pressured the victim to add additional funds, and even agreed to transfer $70,000 USDT to the victim’s account after the victim nearly lost everything in a bad trade. The only condition was that the victim would need to invest an additional $20,000, which he did. When the scammer didn’t show up to a planned in-person meeting, the victim got suspicious and tried to withdraw his money, but his request was delayed by Coinrus.com. Later the victim was told that his account was “at risk” and he needed to pay $70,000 to resolve the issue. He declined to pay, and days later, his account history had been erased from the servers. He lost approximately $70,000.

A third Californian was introduced to Coinrus.com by someone he knew as “Yan Xiaoyu.” She and the victim had been trading in crypto for several months with excellent results. Once “Yan Xiaoyu,” who also uses the handle “@Anna255h” on social media, had gained the victim’s trust, she persuaded him to deposit more than $200K on the platform for their trades. The first few months went well, and the victim’s balance reflected a profit of more than $500K. He had successfully made two withdrawals totaling $30K from his account, but when he tried to make a third withdrawal, the website said he needed to pay $132K in taxes before he could get the money. The victim refused to pay the fees and has since lost all access to his account and he cannot reach customer service for the website. He did receive an email stating that they had taken control of his account and were donating his entire $731K balance to charity. All told, this victim invested and lost more than $200K.

After a couple of weeks, “Anna” introduced the victim to cryptocurrency trading, suggesting it would be an easy way for them to make money for their planned future together. At “Anna’s” urging, the victim transferred his $46,000 life savings to the account she told him to open and invested it. The victim’s account balance appeared to grow to more than $150,000 in less than a month, so he attempted to transfer it back to crypto, taking screenshots of the transaction. When he followed up on the transfer, he was told that he entered the deposit address incorrectly, and the website demanded 20% of the transferring funds as a fee for dealing with his mistake.

Lilly steered the victim to the website www.cmecoinvip.com and showed him how to transfer $9,4000 into stablecoin, which they would then transfer to website to trade “gold futures”, and later showed him that the trades had generated more than $3,000 in profit very quickly. 

The victim was able to complete two small withdrawal transactions from www.cmecoinvip.com, recouping a total of $150 of the money he invested at “Lilly’s” direction. After that, Lilly asked the victim to invest even more money, but he declined. All further attempts to withdraw his money were unsuccessful.

The victim contacted “Lilly” via the “@Lilly666666” username on Telegram, urging her to return his money but she only insulted him. The victim then sent an email to the domain registrar, and reports that the website www.cmecoinvip.com and another affiliated domain were both suspended.","Pig Butchering Scam

The victim claims that he had an agreement with “Donald Henry” that the victim would withdraw his money on a date-certain, after his money had been invested and trading for three weeks. With that understanding, the victim deposited $1,000 into an account on the website Bitglobal Options and watched the account earn a purported $28,000 profit. On the scheduled withdrawal date, the victim submitted a request for the funds as previously agreed but was denied access until he paid a “2961 IRS tax.” The victim contacted “Donald Henry,” who told him that the account balance would be turned over as soon as the victim paid the “tax.” The victim refused, and no money has been returned.

(Entity Impersonating exchange Kuna.io)","A Californian reported losing more than $45,000 after responding to a text message from “Angela,” who implied she had found his phone number in her old phone and decided to reach out to him. Angela then asked that they continue their conversation on Telegram, where she told the victim she was originally from Belarus but now ran her own Fashion Design company in San Francisco. She told the victim about her financial success and how well she had done with cryptocurrency. 

“Angela” offered to teach the victim about trading in cryptocurrency, specifically with the USDT stablecoin, and told him about her uncle, who was purportedly a successful Contract Trader. As described to the victim by “Angela,” Contract Trading involved a complex analysis to maximize the return on investments ranging from $5,000 to $500,000, over short trading intervals lasting between 30 seconds and 5 minutes. “Angela” demonstrated the process by showing the victim that she had invested 50,000 of the stable coins for 30 seconds, appearing to earn approximately $10,000 profit. She insisted that the victim was lucky to have the opportunity to learn from her uncle’s system and convinced the victim to download a trading app called “Kuba” from the site www.kubhe.vip and install it on his smartphone. Shortly after he installed the app, he was directed to install an updated version from the website www.kubhy.vip/download. 

“Angela” continued to identify the trading opportunities for the victim to participate in and convinced him that if they increased the amount of his investment, his profits would be even larger. As a result, the victim transferred over $49,000 to the trading app. When the victim attempted to cash out his profits, Kuna employees declined the transfer and would not release the funds until the victim paid an unspecified “tax” within 7 days. The victim refused and contacted his bank, who advised him to consider those funds irretrievably lost, because he would likely never see that money again.

After “Jenny” walked him through the process of registering for the trading platform and setting up his wallets, the victim made a couple of small “proof of concept” trades totaling several thousand dollars. Although skeptical, he felt more confident after he was able to withdraw $2,000 without any issues. After that, “Jenny” urged the victim to increase his investment for better profit. Investing another $200,000, the victim soon saw his account balance rise to $450,000.

After agreeing to form an investment “partnership” with the victim, “Jenny” appeared to invest $550,000 of “her own” money into the victim’s account, bringing the reported balance of that account to $1M. After more trading sessions, the balance increased to $4.7M, at which point the victim wanted to withdraw the proceeds.
Upon submitting a withdrawal request, the victim was notified by the trading site that his account was locked, and they would only release the funds if the victim deposited an amount equal to 10% of the balance of his account within 15 days. The victim made the deposit, and waited for his money to be released, but the trading site then told him that his account was locked again, unless the victim deposited an additional $400,000. The trading site then offered to put half of the money to unlock the account, if the victim paid the remaining $200,000.

She seemed very knowledgeable in finance and the victim trusted her to help set up an account with a defi protocol on the website: defi.wallet-usdt-eth-erc20.com. He initially put in $1,000.00 to test the system, and since it appeared to be working, he put in an additional $21,000.00. He though he got great results with the website showing mining rewards accruing in his account which were then deposited directly into his wallet on MetaMask. The wallet showed his initial investment funds as always available, and each day he got mining rewards (about 2%) that could be extracted and put into a wallet linked to a so-called “mining pool”. He chatted daily with Jenny about life and crypto. Then the website advertised a reward scheme that offered 12.5 Ethereum coins for every $100,000.00 invested into the platform. Jenny pressured him quite intensely for almost a month to invest so they could get the reward, but he couldn’t come up with the funds. At some point, he liquidated his IRA and put all the rest of his available money into the website account. His total investment at that time was about $37,000.00, and he believed he had earned rewards of $60,000.00. Then he got a message from the website offering a chance to double his rewards in 7 days. He sent the funds to another crypto address outside and was shown that his account had grown to $80,000.00. He wanted to withdraw his funds then, but when he tried, the website demanded he pay taxes of $12,700.00, so he did. Then, he was told he needed to invest an additional 50% of the total asset amount, (another $40,000.00) so that he could take out the $80,000.00 he believed he was in his wallet. He couldn’t pay, so the website agreed to a lower amount, $10,000.00. Immediately after he sent the money, all his money disappeared, and he can no longer communicate with the website.

Cherry Thaddeus","Victim, a single parent with health issues, received a direct message via Instagram from a friend who told her that he had invested $1,000 and got a return of $10,000, and that she could earn money, too, by contacting  cherry_thaddeusfx on Instagram. Victim reached out to “Cherry” and told her she was interested in investing. Cherry was very smart and said she mined for bitcoin. She also claimed to be an account manager and told the victim she would give her a high return on her investment. Victim sent $2,000 to purchase Bitcoin and transferred it to Cherry who told her she had set up an account with her trading company, 247tradegrowth.net. At some point, the victim’s account balance showed she had made a profit of $21,800. But when she attempted to cash out, the victim was told that she had to pay a withdrawal fee of $3,650. She then contacted Cherry, who convinced her to invest another $1,000 worth of bitcoin because he had done so well.  After a week, her account showed a profit of $45,800. This time, when Cherry told her she needed to pay a withdrawal fee, the victim sent $3,700. She had to borrow the money and followed a list of instructions Cherry sent but was told her withdrawal was pending. She contacted Cherry again, who told the victim to give the “Support Team” access to her Instagram account including back up codes. The victim soon received a message from the Support Team saying she needed to pay more fees, up to $12,400 in order to upgrade her account to comply with SEC regulations as her account balance was so high. She called Cherry and pleaded with her that she needed her money back, but Cherry didn’t reply. At this point, the victim realized this was a scam and reset her Instagram account again. She found out from Instagram that the Support Team twice tried to access her account for more money. Later, she learned that her Driver’s License and Social Security Number had been placed on the dark web. She also learned that the friend who had contacted her about Cherry also had had their account hacked, and so it wasn’t even really her friend who first contacted her.","Liquidity Mining Scam

The victim purchased Tether USDT crypto currency from Crypto.com, then connected his offline wallet to the exchange and began trading USDT/Bitcoin futures contracts.  The victim believed he was trading very successfully, so he transferred more money into the platform and believed his acquaintance was also crediting money into his account as well.  The victim made a small withdrawal early in the process to ""test"" the process and his withdrawal went through.  But after more ""successful"" trades, the victim attempted to make a larger withdrawal. At that point, the exchange informed him it did not allow such a large withdrawal, citing “anti-money laundering” protocol established by the “International Banking Regulatory Bureau,” which required him to trade at least 50% of their deposits in their trading account within 24 hours of attempting a withdrawal.   So, the victim deposited more funds into his account, and was told his acquaintance had transferred money into his account as well, so he could withdraw the amount he wanted.  The exchange called this process a “recharge.” Again, the victim believed had made more successful trades and now had enough money to make his planned withdraw as he met the minimum trade threshold.  This time, the exchange denied the withdrawal request, again citing the “International Banking Regulatory Bureau” concern that his account was being used for money laundering, effectively freezing my account to withdrawals. The victim asked how he could prove he was not a money launderer and was told by the exchange he would need to deposit into his wallet the exact amount he had been trying to withdraw, which was $650,000. The victim contacted his trading partner/acquaintance, and she stated her account had also been frozen and that he would need to comply with the exchanges’ instructions. He asked customer service what to do and was told if he transferred the $650,000 and provided a screen shot of the balance, they would release the funds.  The victim took out a loan and deposited about half of the $650,000 in two installments into what he believed was a safe account for such purposes. But as soon as the second deposit went in, without his consent or knowledge the exchange moved the money into his trading account. He protested but was told this was to secure his funds while he finished the verification process. And that the only way to access his money would be to deposit the remaining funds to get to $650,000, although they said they would allow him to trade in the account – just not make withdrawals. His money is now trapped, and he is concerned that there might be problems with the exchange. He is also suspicious about his acquaintance, who told him she followed the exchange’s instructions, borrowed money, and was finally able to withdraw her money and thus encouraged him to borrow more money as well.","Pig Butchering Scam
